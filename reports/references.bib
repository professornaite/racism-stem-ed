@article{Leyva2023,
	abstract = {Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism, cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we present insights from a scoping review of research in language education and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical research on language in mathematics education that left interplay between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.},

@article{Leyva2022,
	abstract = {Undergraduate calculus instruction is a contributor to racialized and gendered trends of STEM persistence and disidentification with mathematics. However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students' perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices -- instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) -- were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants' perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students' experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked. We conclude with implications for practice and research.},

Grants and contracts are essential for an institution's long-term viability; reducing tuition dependence and providing important funding or research, services and programs. However, in 2014, HBCUs accounted for only 0.8 percent of all funds allocated to all institutions of higher education for Research and Development. This investigation used organizational learning theory and focus group research to understand the process through which HBCUs acquire knowledge and translate knowledge into dynamic capabilities to prepare successful proposals to NSF. After analyzing the focus group content, the 5 big ideas related to grant funding success were: develop relationships; take advantage of opportunities, learn as much as you can, change personal mindset, and change institutional culture. Recommendations, based on the results, to overcome barriers to successful proposal submission among HBCUs are provided.},

	abstract = {From the era of European empire to the global trades escalated after the World Wars, technological advancement, one of the key underlying conditions of globalization, has been closely linked with the production and reproduction of the colonizer/colonized. The rhetoric of modernity characterized by ``salvation,'' ``rationality,'' ``development,'' and nature-society or nature-culture divides underlies dominant perspectives on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education that have historically positioned economic development and national security as its core values. Such rhetoric inevitably and implicitly generates the logic of oppression and exploitation. Against the backdrop of nationalist and militaristic discourse representing modernity or coloniality, counter-voices have also arisen to envision a future of STEM education that is more humane and socioecologically just. Such bodies of critiques have interrogated interlocking colonial domains that shape the realm of STEM education: (a) settler colonialism, (b) paternalism, genderism, and coloniality, and (c) militarism and aggression and violence against the geopolitical Other. Our ways of knowing and being with STEM disciplines have been inexorably changed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which powerfully showed us how we live in the global chain of contagion. What kinds of portrayal can we depict if we dismantle colonial imaginaries of STEM education and instead center decolonial love---love that resists the nature-culture or nature-society divide, love to know our responsibilities and enact them in ways that give back, and love that does not neglect historical oppression and violence yet carries us through? STEM education that posits decolonial love at its core will be inevitably and critically transdisciplinary, expanding the epistemological and ontological boundaries to embrace those who had been colonized and disciplined through racialized, gendered, and classist disciplinary practices of STEM.},

@article{samuel2022,
	abstract = {There is an empty quality to much of what passes as ``diversity, equity, and inclusion'' work in legal education. Despite a robust body of scholarship on teaching law consistent with the goals of antiracism, many legal educators struggle to put theory into practice. This Article responds to that struggle, offering a holistic, methodical approach to a pedagogy of antiracism whose goal is twofold: create conditions in which racially minoritized students learn to their full potential, free from the harms of traditional legal education; and equip all students, regardless of identity, to contribute to the dismantlement of structural racism. Absent such pedagogy, legal educators fail to carry out our commitments to students and to equal justice under law, and ignore central duties imposed by ABA accreditation standards. Those standards require an educational setting where all students can learn and, ultimately, become practitioners who carry out what the Model Rules of Professional Conduct call the ``special responsibility for the quality of justice.''

Specifically, this Article describes a five-part pedagogy of antiracism that may be used by legal educators of all experience levels, together with a variety of concrete strategies for putting it into practice. While this methodological superstructure may take somewhat different forms depending on an educator's identity and experience, its core strategies include: (A) understanding antiracism and developing cultural proficiency; (B) understanding and accounting for students' identities and experiences; (C) teaching substance truthfully and in context; (D) implementing inclusive teaching processes; and (E) being actively accountable for choices and harms. By adopting this pedagogy in ways both intentional and continual, law teachers have the potential to counteract the effects of structural racism and contribute to conditions for its dismantlement.},

In the first set of analyses, I examined whether the prevalence of self-reported gender bias varied depending on the educational context. I then examined whether experiencing gender bias was associated with lower STEM self-concept and, if so, whether having a supportive network of STEM peers would buffer this effect. Data were collected through a self-report survey that was administered to high school girls who aspired to have STEM careers, women in STEM undergraduate majors, and women in STEM doctoral programs. Overall, 61% of participants reported experiencing gender bias in the past year, but the prevalence rate varied according to their phase of education and field of study. In particular, women in math-intensive undergraduate majors were especially likely to encounter gender bias, which predominately originated from male peers in their major. As expected, participants who encountered gender bias had lower STEM self-concept than participants who did not. However, this effect was attenuated for participants who also had a supportive network of STEM peers. These findings suggest that positive peer connections may be a valuable resource for girls and women in the STEM pipeline.},

Yet how instructors think about race and racism can impact whether and how they adopt inclusive practices. We examined how 39 undergraduate STEM instructors noticed anti-Black racialized events that were experienced by students in classroom narratives. We created narrative cases that described multiple common, harmful anti-Black racialized experiences based on extant research and guidance from an expert advisory board. Instructors responded to cases by describing the problems they noticed. Using frameworks of racial noticing and color-evasive racial ideology, we conducted qualitative content analysis of instructor responses. Color-evasive racial ideology was pervasive, with most responses (54%) avoiding any discussion of race, and few responses acknowledging race or racism in more than one event (10%). We characterized six forms of color-evasiveness. This study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that color-evasion is pervasive in STEM culture. Instructors would benefit from professional development that specifically aims to counter color-evasiveness and anti-Blackness in teaching. Furthermore, STEM disciplines must pursue systemic change so that our organizations value, expect, promote, and reward the development and enactment of a critical racial consciousness.},

In higher education, performance in core introductory courses required for STEM degrees is strongly associated with degree completion. Leveraging a multi-institutional database, we examine nearly 110,000 student records from six large, public, research-intensive universities in order to assess whether these introductory courses disproportionately weed out underrepresented minority (URM) students. We find that the association between low performance in an introductory STEM class and failure to obtain a STEM degree is stronger for URM students than for other students, even after controlling for academic preparation in high school and intent to obtain a STEM degree. To facilitate interpretation of our multivariate logistic regression model, and to highlight the dire situation in higher education, we also calculate predicted probabilities of STEM degree attainment for students of various demographics. The probability of obtaining a STEM degree for a STEM-intending white male student with average academic preparation who receives grades of C or better in all introductory courses is 48%. In contrast, for an otherwise similar URM female student, the probability is merely 35%. If these students receive less than a C in even one introductory STEM course, the probabilities drop to 33% and 21%, respectively.},

These preconceptions were based on the idea that nature, and not social forces, created divisions in society, and ``the physiological, cultural, and economic woes of the poor and the nonaffluent `middling classes' were scientifically ordained by Nature, and neither preventable nor reversible'' (3).

Moreover, disparities occur across all disciplinary directorates within the NSF and are greater for research proposals. The distributions of average external review scores also exhibit systematic offsets based on PI race.

These institutional and societal systems build-in individual bias and racialized interactions, resulting in systemic racism. Unconscious inferences, empirically established from perceptions onward, demonstrate non-Black Americans' inbuilt associations: pairing Black Americans with negative valences, criminal stereotypes, and low status, including animal rather than human. Implicit racial biases (improving only slightly over time) imbed within non-Black individuals' systems of racialized beliefs, judgments, and affect that predict racialized behavior. Interracial interactions likewise convey disrespect and distrust. These systematic individual and interpersonal patterns continue partly due to non-Black people's inexperience with Black Americans and reliance on societal caricatures. Despite systemic challenges, Black Americans are more diverse now than ever, due to resilience (many succeeding against the odds), immigration (producing varied backgrounds), and intermarriage (increasing the multiracial proportion of the population). Intergroup contact can foreground Black diversity, resisting systemic racism, but White advantages persist in all economic, political, and social domains. Cognitive science has an opportunity: to include in its study of the mind the distortions of reality about individual humans and their social groups.

	abstract = {{This chapter depicts ``the real record on racial attitudes'' using a wide lens. Recounting results of mid-20th-century surveys as well as trends in the General Social Survey, it shows that formal principles of equal treatment (e.g., in schools and employment) came to be widely endorsed. However, it cautions against concluding that U.S. society became ``postracial.'' For example, in the 2000s white Americans remain more apt to attribute negative traits to blacks than to whites, reluctant to support interventions to redress persistent black--white inequality, and highly resistant to ``special favors'' for blacks. The chapter documents rising egalitarianism and dramatic change in some basic assumptions governing black--white relationships, together with little or no growth in reformist and interventionist orientations about racial matters. It highlights numerous ``enduring frictions and conflicts that continue to make race such a fraught terrain.''}},

	abstract = {In this article, Teresa L. McCarty and Tiffany S. Lee present critical culturally sus-
taining/revitalizing pedagogy as a necessar y concept to understand and guide edu-
cational  practices  for  Native  American  learners.  Premising  their  discussion  on  the  
fundamental  role  of  tribal  sovereignty  in  Native  American  schooling,  the  authors  
underscore and extend lessons from Indigenous culturally based, culturally relevant, 
and  culturally  responsive  schooling.  Drawing  on  Paris's  (2012)  and  Paris  and  
Alim's  (2014)  notion  of  culturally  sustaining  pedagogy  (CSP),  McCarty  and  Lee  
argue that given the current linguistic, cultural, and educational realities of Native 
American communities, CSP in these settings must also be understood as culturally 
revitalizing pedagogy. Using two ethnographic cases as their foundation, they explore 
what culturally sustaining/revitalizing pedagogy (CSRP) looks like in these settings 
and  consider  its  possibilities,  tensions,  and  constraints.  They  highlight  the  ways  in  
which  implementing  CSRP  necessitates  an  ``inward  gaze''  (Paris  &  Alim,  2014),  
whereby  colonizing  influences  are  confronted  as  a  crucial  component  of  language  
and culture reclamation. Based on this analysis, they advocate for community-based 
educational accountability that is rooted in Indigenous education sovereignty},

@book{Karaali2019,
	abstract = {Several years ago, Dr. Eva Curry of Acadia University invited us to participate in a panel titled ``Proving Hardy Wrong: Research Mathematics with Social Justice Applications''. We were tasked with countering G. H. Hardy's characterization of worthwhile math- ematics as a purely abstract -- and perhaps esoteric -- discipline, and challenging his claim that ``[a] science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth, or more directly promotes the de- struction of human life''. Although in his A Mathematician's Apology Hardy notes that this quote was in part a rhetorical flourish, it does invite the search for examples of mathematics which serve to counter inequality and improve human welfare.
During the panel, held at the 2011 Joint Mathematics Meetings in New Orleans, we shared each of our own journeys connecting mathematics to social issues, one focused on public school districting and the other on policing practices in Los Angeles. We were deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the audience members and their willingness to seek out ways in which mathematicians could address social justice issues in their own work.
There are, of course, numerous strands to the broad theme ``Mathematics for Social Justice'', from employing equitable teaching practices to challenging stereotypes and misconceptions about who gets to do mathematics. Hardy's claim requires us, how- ever, to examine course content in particular, as well as the ways that students can be empowered to use mathematical reasoning and tools in social and political contexts.
We thank Dr. Curry for inviting us to that 2011 panel; she started us on a joint path which led to these volumes. In the intervening years, we have been motivated to bring these topics and others into the mathematics classroom. We were delighted to find that many other mathematicians were excited by similar ideas. This volume, together with the companion text Mathematics for Social Justice: Focusing on Quantitative Reasoning and Statistics, represents the work of over forty such mathematicians and academics, thoughtful instructors who have developed original course materials with the under- standing that today's college students deserve to have the mathematical tools to tackle a wider range of real-world problems.
We have been greatly inspired by our contributors, who have taken on issues from voting rights to racial inequality. We hope that readers will be similarly inspired.

Nevertheless, he also demonstrated a sophisticated and critical engagement with natural science. He recognized that the sciences were socially situated, but also that they addressed real questions and issues. Debate remains, however, regarding exactly how and why Du Bois incorporated such natural scientific knowledge into his own thinking. In this article, we draw on archival research and Du Bois' own scholarship to investigate his general approach to interdisciplinarity. We address how and why he fused natural scientific knowledge and the influence of physical environs into his social science, intertwining each with his broader intellectual and political aims. This investigation will offer a fuller understanding of the scope and aims of his empirical scholarship. At the same time, it will illuminate a sociological approach to natural science that can still inform scholarship today.},

@book{Hobson2017,
	abstract = {For more than a century, the city of Atlanta has been associated with black achievement in education, business, politics, media, and music, earning it the nickname "the black Mecca." Atlanta's long tradition of black education dates back to Reconstruction, and produced an elite that flourished in spite of Jim Crow, rose to leadership during the civil rights movement, and then took power in the 1970s by building a coalition between white progressives, business interests, and black Atlantans. But as Maurice J. Hobson demonstrates, Atlanta's political leadership--from the election of Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, through the city's hosting of the 1996 Olympic Games--has consistently mishandled the black poor. Drawn from vivid primary sources and unnerving oral histories of working-class city-dwellers and hip-hop artists from Atlanta's underbelly, Hobson argues that Atlanta's political leadership has governed by bargaining with white business interests to the detriment of ordinary black Atlantans.
In telling this history through the prism of the black New South and Atlanta politics, policy, and pop culture, Hobson portrays a striking schism between the black political elite and poor city-dwellers, complicating the long-held view of Atlanta as a mecca for black people.},

To articulate and justify this conception, Shulman responds to four questions: What are the sources of the knowledge base for teaching?In what terms can these sources be conceptualized? What are the processes of pedagogical reasoning and action? and What are the implications for teaching policy and educational reform? The answers --- informed by philosophy, psychology, and a growing body of casework based on young and experienced practitioners --- go far beyond current reform assumptions and initiatives. The outcome for educational practitioners, scholars, and policymakers is a major redirection in how teaching is to be understood and teachers are to be trained and evaluated.},

I, like countless teachers and university-based researchers, have been inspired by what it means to make teaching and learning relevant and responsive to the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students across categories of difference and (in)equality. Recently, however, I have begun to question if the terms ``relevant'' and ``responsive'' are really descriptive of much of the teaching and research founded upon them and, more importantly, if they go far enough in their orientation to the languages and literacies and other cultural practices of communities marginalized by systemic inequalities to ensure the valuing and maintenance of our multiethnic and multilingual society. In this essay, I offer the term and stance of culturally sustaining pedagogy as an alternative that, I believe, embodies some of the best research and practice in the resource pedagogy tradition and as a term that supports the value of our multiethnic and multilingual present and future. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to perpetuate and foster---to sustain---linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling. In the face of current policies and practices that have the explicit goal of creating a monocultural and monolingual society, research and practice need equally explicit resistances that embrace cultural pluralism and cultural equality.},

That's great for learning (because you don't want to struggle with data handling while you're learning visualisation), but in real life, datasets hardly ever come in exactly the right structure. To use ggplot2 in practice, you'll need to learn some data wrangling skills. Indeed, in my experience, visualisation is often the easiest part of the data analysis process: once you have the right data, in the right format, aggregated in the right way, the right visualisation is often obvious.},

A National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. It will emphasize core underlying principles, intellectual content, and pedagogical issues specific to data science, including core concepts that distinguish it from neighboring disciplines. It will not consider the practicalities of creating materials, courses, or programs. It will develop this vision considering applications of and careers in data science. It will focus on the undergraduate level, addressing related issues at the middle and high school level as well as community colleges as appro- priate, and will draw on experiences in creating master's-level programs. It will also consider opportunities created by the emergence of a new science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field to engage underrepresented student populations and consider ways to reduce the ``leakage'' seen in existing STEM pathways. Information gathering will center around two workshops, the first likely focused on principles and intellectual content, and the second likely focused on pedagogy and implications for middle and high schools and community colleges. To get material on the record quickly and spark community feedback, a rapporteur- authored workshop summary report will be issued following the first workshop. A final report will be issued following both workshops and committee deliberations setting forth a vision for undergraduate education in data science.},

We present a case study of a critical conversation that took place at a 2016 Mathematics for Social Justice workshop organized by a group of junior faculty. Participant reflections situate perspectives that can help novice and experienced instructors design conversations about teaching mathematics for social justice. Specifically, individual and group reflections highlight the importance of: (i) framing and reflecting on the conversation; (ii) exploring implications and content connections; and (iii) identifying barriers.

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

@article{Gigerenzer2018,
	abstract = {The ``replication crisis'' has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game 
hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith 
in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The ``null ritual,'' unknown in statistics 
proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the 
p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 -- p), which makes replication studies appear to 
be  superfluous.  A  review  of  studies  with  839  academic  psychologists  and  991  students  shows  that  the  replication  
delusion  existed  among  20%  of  the  faculty  teaching  statistics  in  psychology,  39%  of  the  professors  and  lecturers,  
and 66% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an 
effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 -- 
p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the 
majority of researchers (56%--97%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin 
teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as 
``significant'' or ``not significant.''},

Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants' experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners' capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society.

	abstract = {As the demand for data scientists continues to grow, universities are trying to figure out how to best contribute to the training of a workforce. However, there does not appear to be a consensus on the fundamental principles, expertise, skills, or knowledge-base needed to define an academic discipline. We argue that data science is not a discipline but rather an umbrella term used to describe a complex process involving not one data scientist possessing all the necessary expertise, but a team of data scientists with nonoverlapping complementary skills. We provide some recommendations for how to take this into account when designing data science academic programs.},

@article{Peng2021,
	abstract = {Teaching data analysis by providing students with real-world problems and datasets allows students to integrate a variety of skills in a situation that mirrors how data analysis actually works. However, whole data analyses may obscure the individual skills of data analytic practice that are generalizable across data analyses. One such skill is the ability to diagnose the cause of unexpected results in a data analysis. While experienced analysts can quickly iterate through a series of potential explanations when confronted with unexpected results, novice analysts often struggle to figure out how to move forward. The goal of this paper is to describe an approach to teaching students skills in diagnosing data analytic problems. The exercise described here is targeted to allow students to practice this skill and to assess the depth of their knowledge about the statistical tools they have learned. We take a hypothetical case study approach and focus on the students' reasoning through their diagnoses and suggestions for follow up action. We found the implementation of this exercise in a small graduate course to provide valuable information about students' diagnostic thought processes, but further work is needed regarding structured approaches to implementation and the design of assessments.},

	abstract = {Data science is collaborative and its students should learn teamwork and collaboration. 
Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science 
curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help 
educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group 
collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence 
of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science 
learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe 
the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to 
support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application 
exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a 
modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught 
reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication 
and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning 
of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education 
community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on 
using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using 
TBL to teach data science.},

Culture is defined as the conjugate product of two reciprocal, componential processes. The first is a dynamically stable process of collectively made, reproduced, and unevenly shared knowledge structures that are informational and mean- ingful, internally embodied, and externally represented and that provide predictability, coordination equilibria, continuity, and meaning in hu- man actions and interactions. The second is a pragmatic component of culture that grounds the first, and it has its own rules of usage and a pragmatically derived structure of practical knowledge. I also offer an account of change and draw on knowledge activation theory in explor- ing the microdynamics of cultural practice and propose the concept of cultural configuration as a better way of studying cultural practice in highly heterogeneous modern societies where people shift between multiple, overlapping configurations.},

Here, the program is described and compared to standard data science curricula as they were organized in 2014 and 2015. We show that novel pedagogical and administrative decisions introduced in our program are now standard in online data science programs.

CRT scholars have applied a critical race framework to advance research methodologies, namely qualitative interventions. Informed by this work, and 15 years later, this article reconsiders the possibilities of CRT applications to quantitative methodologies through `QuantCrit.' We ask the question: Can quantitative methods, long critiqued for their inability to capture the nuance of everyday experience, support and further a critical race agenda in educational research? We provide an abbreviated sketch of some of the key tenets of CRT and the enduring interdisciplinary contributions in race and quantitative studies. Second, we examine the legacy and genealogy of QuantCrit traditions across the disciplines to uncover a rich lineage of methodological possibilities for disrupting racism in research. We argue that quantitative approaches cannot be adopted for racial justice aims without an ontological reckoning that considers historical, social, political, and economic power relations. Only then can quantitative approach be re-imagined and rectified.},

	abstract = {This article describes an innovative curriculum module the first author created on the two-way exchange between statistics and applied ethics. The module, having no particular mathematical prerequisites beyond high school algebra, is part of an undergraduate interdisciplinary ethics course which begins with a 3-week introduction to basic applied ethics taught by a philosophy professor (the second author), and continues with 3-week modules from professors in various other disciplines. The first author's module's emphasis on conceptual and critical thinking makes it easily adaptable to service-level courses as well as readily expandable for more mathematically sophisticated audiences. Through in-class explorations and discussions, the module made connections to contemporary topics such as the death penalty, equal pay for equal work, and profiling. This article shares examples, resources, strategies and lessons learned for instructors wishing to develop their own modules of various lengths.

@article{curran2016,
	abstract = {Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eleventh installment of Explorations in Statis- tics explores statistical facets of reproducibility. If we obtain an experimental result that is scientifically meaningful and statistically unusual, we would like to know that our result reflects a general biological phenomenon that another researcher could reproduce if (s)he repeated our experiment. But more often than not, we may learn this researcher cannot replicate our result. The National Institutes of Health and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology have created training modules and outlined strategies to help improve the reproducibility of research. These particular approaches are necessary, but they are not sufficient. The principles of hypothesis testing and estimation are inherent to the notion of reproducibility in science. If we want to improve the reproducibility of our research, then we need to rethink how we apply fundamental concepts of statistics to our science.},

@article{Zuberi2000,
	abstract = {Race is usually defined as an individual attribute fixed at birth and is employed by researchers as a variable with potential for causing change in some other aspect of that same individual. When an individual's race can change (as in Brazil), race is not an at- tribute but a dynamic characteristic dependent on other social cir- cumstances. In the United States, an individual's race cannot change and thus is considered an individual attribute. As such, social statis- ticians may have measured racial classification correctly. The major error is in how race has been interpreted. The author suggests a new language to express things that our current language handles inade- quately. This new language attempts to increase the efficiency of communication about the statistical analysis of race.},
