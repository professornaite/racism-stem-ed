AB PurposeLocal and national U.S. programs focused on diversifying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in academia and industry have created academic pathways for Black Engineers. However, most STEM diversity programs in doctoral education typically end or availability significantly decreases. This absence leaves little or limited guidance during the challenging process of completing this terminal degree and seeking employment.MethodWe interviewed 43 Black PhD engineering and computing doctoral students, 37 discussed their experiences receiving equity-minded mentorship in a STEM diversity program, and we asked them about the value and lapsing of this programming.ResultsThese doctoral students felt the absence of equity-minded mentoring through culturally affirming diversity programming. Often, funding for these programs has been reduced or eliminated for graduate students. National conferences, sponsored by national societies, partially filled the vacuum, offering equity-minded mentoring that affirmed STEM identities.DiscussionWe propose that doctoral students benefit from institutionally-maintained diversity programs that address racial disparities. These programs could provide mentoring focused on equity and based on a clear comprehension of structural racism in STEM fields. They also offer counter-narratives that challenge the underrepresentation of Black individuals in STEM.

AB While there is increased attention to power, privilege, and access in mathematics education, conversations around race and disability are often left out of the conversation. Disability in mathematics continues to be studied with a lens that focuses on behavior, rather than attending to the situated and sociopolitical context in which teaching and learning takes place. This paper specifically calls on the importance of an intersectional analysis of ability and the need for explicit conversation on the interwoven nature of race and disability to uncover exclusionary practices of hyper-labeling, hyper-surveilling, and hyper-punishing for those outside notions of normalcy. Drawing on sociopolitical perspectives informed by Disability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) and DisCrit Classroom Ecology, I share a framework of DisCrit noticing to consider the interwoven nature of racism and ableism in mathematics classrooms, provide a context to develop preservice teacher DisCrit noticing during mathematics methods, and a case example to highlight implications and transformative possibilities for (re)organizing classrooms through the DisCrit noticing framework.

AB Amidst this era of rapid technological advancement, the impact of White dominance in STEM causes inequity throughout the design, implementation, and function of modern technologies. Evidence of this includes AI systems that perpetuate racial and gender biases, medical devices that are incompatible with non-White medical needs, and hiring algorithms that prioritize the White male experience. Though not a panacea, greater representation of traditionally marginalized groups in the STEM workforce will help reduce and safeguard against digital racism, sexism, and ableism. Advocates of greater representation in STEM fields suggest that makerspace pedagogy and design that is rooted in equity and inclusivity can attract students from traditionally marginalized groups and make STEM more accessible and welcoming to all. To this end, this paper proposes a modification of the TPACK theoretical framework (Koehler and Mishra in Contemp Issues Tech Teach Educ 9(1):60-70, 2009) that centers knowledge of technological and inclusive practices in Makerspaces, giving rise to the Maker Technology, Pedagogy, Inclusion, and Content Knowledge (MakerTPICK) theoretical framework. Additionally, this paper presents the Makerspace Planning, Implementation, Establishment, and Reassessment (PIER) conceptual framework. This framework outlines the process for makerspace leaders to create and sustain an inclusive makerspace through the MakerTPICK framework, be they teachers in a school setting or makerspace coordinators outside of the field of K-12 education. The paper describes future implications for these frameworks in terms of practical applications for makerspaces and applied to research settings.

AB This paper begins with a discussion of a program of work to map and embed Indigenous perspectives at RMIT University, outlines issues relating to the uptake of its guiding principles and actions, and then proposes a rethinking of the work. The authors argue that non-Indigenous educators are often ill equipped to undertake curriculum deconstruction or review. They lack a comprehensive understanding of colonial history, truth telling, racism, and the impact of power dynamics, with its institutional privileging of whiteness. It is often only with this foundational knowledge that staff are positioned to undertake curriculum analysis and ensure that their teaching environments are culturally safe. While this paper is case specific, the original project and the reconsideration of behaviours and actions are relevant to all educational institutions facing similar stumbling blocks when it comes to informing educators in the knowledge and capabilities required to include Indigenous perspectives in curricula and to create safe teaching environments.

AB A wealth of data has consistently demonstrated that a diverse faculty maximizes productivity and innovation in the research enterprise and increases the persistence and success of groups that are underrepresented in STEM. While the diversity of students in graduate programs has steadily increased, faculty diversity, particularly in the biomedical sciences, continues to remain relatively flat. Several issues contribute to this mismatch between the pipeline and the professoriate including biases in search and hiring practices, lack of equity and equal opportunities for individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, and unwelcoming campus climates that lead to marginalization and isolation in academic life. A comprehensive approach that addresses these challenges is necessary for institutions of higher education to achieve their faculty diversity goals and create a climate where individuals from all groups feel welcomed and succeed. This article focuses on the first step in this approach-diversifying faculty recruitment through adopting search practices that generate an applicant pool that matches national availability, ensures equity in evaluation and hiring practices, and promotes inclusion and belonging in the hiring experience. These strategies have been recently used at the University of California, Irvine's School of Biological Sciences and while the long-term impact remains unknown, short-term outcomes in recruitment and hiring have demonstrated significant improvement over previous years.

AB Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the chemistry classroom is crucial for creating an inclusive learning environment that will have a positive effect on student's learning, success, and hence, retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). As such, a number of DEI approaches have recently been identified to foster awareness and appreciation of DEI into undergraduate chemistry education. However, in addition to creating DEI awareness, studies or educational approaches whereby undergraduate students are being exposed to some basic DEI knowledge are limited. Hence, in this work, three key DEI initiatives were incorporated into a first semester of Organic Chemistry at a primarily undergraduate institution. The first initiative included a weekly 5-10 min DEI video-discussion activity focusing on building awareness and basic knowledge such as DEI terminology, implicit bias, microaggression, gender, and systemic racism in STEM. The profile of several Black scientists as well as women scientists who have changed the world were also highlighted. The second initiative involved the design of five DEI-based extra credit assignments that connected course content (or concepts) with the historical achievements of a diverse set of chemists. Finally, DEI-based bonus questions were incorporated in three term exams as a formal assessment of student's DEI learning throughout the semester. Pre- and post-DEI-related surveys were conducted, and students' feedback about their DEI learning experiences were overall largely positive. Student scores and answers on the DEI-based activities were analyzed, and the results indicated an increase in the awareness and basic knowledge of DEI in STEM education.

AB Black fathers and daughters are the least explored relationship within parent-child and STEM research. This article serves as an examination of the literature around their relationships and STEM learning and as a call to action. Intersectionality, as an analytic lens, examines Black fathers' familial and STEM relationships over time and Black women's and girls' (BWG's) interest and competence in STEM, as well as how systemic factors of gendered racism, classism, and oppression impacted BWG's aspirations in STEM, computing, and mathematics fields. Data yielded 29 publications addressing Black fathers and daughters in STEM, their relationships, and BWG's interest and competence in STEM, computing, and mathematics learning. Findings reveal that Black fathers' roles in their daughter's STEM lives helps develop positive representations of themselves and their cultural backgrounds. This acknowledgement produces a new level of understanding of Black fathers and girls' engagement in informal and formal STEM learning environments.

AB Although racial and ethnic demographics are shifting in this country, it is not reflected in the diversity of clinical trial research participants; science, technology, engineering, and mathematics pipeline programs; or the workforce in the field of dermatology. Barriers to recruitment of minority patients for research studies also exist for numerous reasons including lack of education of prospective subjects, lack of awareness of ongoing trials, and mistrust within the health care system. Gaps in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics pipeline for racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian or Alaska Native, are due in large part to structural racism. Lack of exposure as well as lack of educational, mentorship, and research opportunities contribute to gaps in the dermatology workforce. Having a representative population in the dermatology workforce and in clinical research trial patients is essential for optimum patient care, excellence in the specialty, and knowledge of appropriate treatments for minority populations. This article will discuss knowledge gaps for increasing minority subjects who participate in clinical research trials and discuss mechanisms to engage this community in trial recruitment. Additionally, this article addresses lack of racial and ethnic diversity of the dermatology workforce and performance gaps in the recruitment of racial/ethnic minorities into dermatology.

AB There is a mountain of evidence demonstrating that students with marginalized, i.e. purposefully socially excluded, identities experience significantly worse academic and social outcomes in STEM disciplines. However, there has been less attention on how white women, who experience sexism due to their gender but are privileged due to their race, simultaneously contribute to and play a role in dismantling systemic racism. In this study, I used constructivist grounded theory to explore the process through which white women in STEM commit to racial justice both within and outside of their disciplines. Interviews with 36 white women in STEM across a range of disciplines helped build an emergent model that illustrated how participants advanced through three stages to move toward actionable anti-racist commitment. However, many participants struggled to connect STEM with their anti-racist practice, as many STEM disciplines lacked anti-racism curriculum and/or the ability to practice anti-racism within STEM. This model helps illustrate the complex process in which white women in STEM become committed to racial justice. Within STEM specifically, this research has direct implications for the importance of adding social contexts and anti-racist material directly into STEM curricula to foster anti-racist practices for future STEM professionals.

A key player in this endeavor should be STEM education, which has the potential to equip learners with the skills and knowledge necessary to address intersectional issues such as climate change, health and income disparities, racism, and political divisions. However, in this article we argue that despite the transformative potential of STEM education, it remains far removed from most people's lived experiences and is detached from the real-world social, political, and economic contexts in which it exists. This detachment not only perpetuates existing inequities by failing to meet the specific needs and reflect the experiences of these communities, but it also hampers STEM education's capacity to address the very local and global problems it is purported to solve. By remaining removed from the tangible, real-world contexts in which it exists, STEM education cannot fully harness its potential to better humanity. To address these issues, we propose humanizing STEM education by intentionally and explicitly grounding all work in the recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of all students, regardless of their background. We begin the article by critically examining the typically unspoken pre-existing assumptions or "agreements" that govern and dictate the norms of teaching and learning within STEM, ways of approaching framing STEM education that we often take for granted as necessary and true. We propose new agreements that expand the ways in which we think about STEM education, in hopes of making STEM education more accessible, inclusive, relevant, responsive, and reparative. Throughout, we deliberate on the notion of being human. We argue that to envision a future of humanistic STEM, one that is intentionally grounded in an ethics of care and equity for all, including the environment, it is necessary to continue to make visible and reimagine the unarticulated assumptions that underlie our current approaches to STEM education and practice.

TI Racism, Power, And Health Equity: The Case Of Tenant Organizing
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; POLITICS; MARGINS; JUSTICE; IMPACT; STATE
AB Racial disparities in health are among the most disconcerting forms of inequity in the United States. Divergent health outcomes between Americans racialized as White and those racialized as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous do not stem from biological or genetic differences. To the contrary, "race" comes to have concrete consequences through social, economic, and political systems. Yet the political contours of health equity remain especially understudied. This article places the politics of health equity in the foreground through the lens of housing, a critical determinant of health. Drawing on in-depth qualitative evidence rooted in the experiences of tenants who confront health-threatening housing conditions, I examine how people within racially and economically marginalized communities organize to build political power in response to those conditions. By charting how tenants navigate state and local political processes, I demonstrate the possibilities for organized tenants to wield power in ways that help advance health equity in the face of structural racism.

AB Guided by a combination of LatCrit and intersectionality this study examined the challenges Latina Multilingual Learners' (ML) experienced in STEM and how their multiple marginalized identities (i.e. being Latina, female, and non-native English-speaker) and the oppression related to class, gender, race, and ethnicity influence their perspectives. Using an interpretive phenomenological design, we interviewed 10 Latina ML students from four universities. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis yielded multiple major challenges in navigating through their undergraduate STEM programs: (a) academic challenges, (b) doubts and lack of confidence, (c) discriminations and biases against Latinas. Also, we discussed how system racism and intersectionality of multiple marginalized identity of Latina ML (i.e. class, gender, race, ethnicity and language) influence and interact with their experiences in STEM.

TI The DECAY of Merton's scientific norms and the new academic ethos
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION

DT Article; Early Access
DE communism, universalism, disinterestedness and organized scepticism
   (CUDOS); Merton; STEM; scientific ethos; neoliberalism; performativity
ID SCIENCE; UNIVERSALISM
AB This article provides a conceptual reformulation of Merton's scientific ethos widely known by the acronym CUDOS (i.e. communism, universalism, disinterestedness and organised scepticism). While Merton perceived the threat to the autonomy of science as coming from outside the walls of academe, mainly in the form of nationalism and racism, the subsequent rise of neoliberalism and global market forces means that the scientific ethos is being undermined largely from within the university itself, leading to the DECAY (i.e. differentialism, egoism, capitalism and advocacy) of CUDOS. The STEM-ification of the humanities and social sciences academic community has led to the rise of a post-academic ethos. This manifests itself in professional pragmatism with academics facing both ways at the same time by remaining largely committed to Mertonian norms in theory but needing to adapt to the performative demands of DECAY as a new set of institutional norms that prevails in practice.

AB Black Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) college students face a number of challenges in higher education contexts, such as racism and discrimination from faculty. Furthermore, systemic minoritization has resulted in a dearth of Black STEM faculty that can help Black STEM students navigate racially hostile academic climates. As a result, Black students may have to rely on non-Black faculty for support and allyship, which is concerning given reports of inappropriate behaviors and common pitfalls perpetrated by aspiring allies. Surprisingly, few studies have examined Black students' perspectives toward faculty allies and appropriate ally behaviors, which limit the effectiveness of aspiring faculty allies. Therefore, this study used semistructured interviews to investigate Black STEM graduate students' perspectives about faculty ally behaviors. Three categories emerged-prepare to be an ally, foster credibility, and practice active allyship. In addition, the three categories informed the preliminary design of the multidimensional axis of allyship development framework, which contributes to how allyship development is conceptualized and offers practical insights for research, Black students, and aspiring faculty allies.

AB OrgoPrep, a summer preparatory program integrating multipleactive-learningelements (i.e., interactive videos with problem-solving and feedback,synchronous peer-led instruction, and collaborative work), was previouslyshown to improve academic outcomes in organic chemistry for all students.The present study examined how OrgoPrep differentially impacted studentsbelonging to historically marginalized groups, including those identifyingas women, Black, Hispanic, or first-generation as well as those classifiedas low-income. As a result of multifaceted systemic barriers, thesestudents receive lower grades and leave STEM at higher rates comparedto their peers, highlighting the need for equity-focused educationalinterventions. Drawing upon Quantitative Critical Race Theory, educationaldebts in organic chemistry owed by society were calculated for eachmarginalized group. As a result of participating in OrgoPrep, educationaldebts in GPA points were reduced or mitigated for nearly all marginalizedgroups, with the largest benefits seen in Black students. Disproportionatelylarger mitigative impacts on attrition measured via drop, failure,and withdrawal (DFW) rates were detected for nearly all marginalizedgroups. Specifically, debts in the DFW rate were reduced for womenand low-income students and eliminated for Black and Hispanic students.These findings demonstrate that OrgoPrep can appreciably reduce educationaldebts due to racism and sexism with a mixed impact on debts due toclassism. Similar supplementary programs may play a key role in mitigatingthe effects of racism, sexism, and classism in the STEM pipeline.

AB Having a multiplicity of identities not only makes it difficult to find inclusive spaces for Aboriginal bisexual+ (bi) people but may often be a barrier to building connections and relationships with people who have other queer identities. Bi + identities alone are often rendered invisible, unintelligible or erased when it comes to inclusion and solidarity among their peers. An intersectional lens is used to reflexively investigate existing literature to explore how a lack of solidarity among lateral communities may impact Aboriginal bi + people in Australia who face an array of racism and queerphobia from both LGBTQ + and Aboriginal communities. These unique and multifaceted layers of discrimination greatly impact mental health and wellbeing. These experiences stem from the heterosexist and monosexist status quo from heteropatriarchal settler colonialism that is seen in both Aboriginal and LGBTQ + communities respectively. As a result, Aboriginal queer people are constantly surveying risks, policing their own identities and identity expression, often hiding parts of their identity as a survival strategy to avoid rejection and adhere to dominant cultural norms. When specifically considering Aboriginal bi + identities, there are added unique stressors of lateral violence with other LGBTQ + groups, antibisexual prejudice, and assumed monosexuality, adding additional layers of minority stress. The author explores these experiences by extending upon borderland theory and minority stress models. Whilst there is solace in the holistic celebration of intersecting identities in emerging intersectional Aboriginal queer spaces, there is still a great need for solidarity and celebration of Aboriginal bi + people within the broader LGBTQ + community.

AB In emerging economies, economic development and pro-social policies are closely entwined. Multinational corporations have presented a positive image of their economic and social activities to investors and society to justify exploiting countries' natural resources. This study examines the Arabian American Oil Company's (Aramco) pro-social/corporate social responsibility programs in employment, housing, and healthcare from 1932 to 1974. These programs did not stem from a philanthropic rationale but were necessary to enable Aramco to create the infrastructure to find, extract, and control the oil assets. Hierarchical control was institutionalized through racism and discrimination in employment, housing, and health regulations. However, Aramco adopted impression management strategies to present a positive image of itself as a socially responsible company contributing to the economic and social development of Saudi Arabia. We analyze management statements in company reports and internal documents to identify and categorize the application of these impression management techniques up to when the Saudi government took a controlling stake in Aramco.

TI A Communitywide Collaboration to Increase Enrollment, Retention, and
   Success in Evidence-Based Lifestyle-Change Programs in Racial and Ethnic
   Minority Populations
SO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID DISPARITIES; CARE
AB Purpose and Objectives Chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, hypertension) are the leading causes of death in the US and disproportionally affect racial and ethnic minority populations. This disparity is partially due to the unequal burden of unmet social needs that stem from several factors, including racism.Intervention Approach The Alliance is a collaboration among health care, public health, and community organizations formed to improve referral, enrollment, and successful completion of evidence-based lifestyle change programs, particularly among Black people. The Alliance built 1) a system to assess and address social barriers through the screening and referral process and 2) a training center for frontline staff (eg, community health workers). Evaluation Methods From January 2020 through September 2022, we conducted an evaluation that included both quantitative and qualitative methods. We developed an electronic database to make referrals and track key barriers to participation. Additionally, we conducted a focus group among frontline staff (N = 15) to understand the challenges in making referrals and discussing, documenting, and addressing barriers to participation. We used surveys that collected quantitative and open-ended qualitative responses to evaluate the training center and to understand perceptions of training modules as well as the skills gained.Results Frontline staff engaged with 6,036 people, of whom 847 (14%) were referred to a lifestyle-change program from January 2020 through September 2022. Of those referred, 257 (30%) were eligible and enrolled in a program. Food access and unreliable inter net were the most common barriers to participation. Thirteen of 15 frontline staff participated in trainings, and, on average, trainees completed 4.2 trainings and gained several skills (eg, ability to monitor personal bias, de-escalate a crisis, educate on mental health, understand community and environmental factors). Implications for Public Health The Alliance is an example of how health care, public health, and community partners can work together to increase enrollment in lifestyle-change programs of residents disproportionately affected by chronic diseases. Lessons learned from implementation and evaluation can inform other complex partnerships to improve public health.

AB IntroductionSeldom has work investigated systematic biases in adults' truth and lie judgments of children's reports. Research demonstrates that adults tend to exhibit a bias toward believing a child is telling the truth, but it is unknown whether this truth bias applies equally to all children. Given the pervasiveness of racial prejudice and anti-Black racism in the United States, the current study examined whether adults are more or less likely to believe a child is telling the truth based on the race of the child (Black or White), the race of the adult perceiver (Black or White), and the perceiver's concerns regarding appearing unprejudiced. MethodsUsing an online data-collection platform, 593 Black and White American adults reviewed fictitious vignettes in which a child denied committing a misbehavior at school (e.g., damaging a laptop). The race of the child in the vignette was manipulated using an AI-generated photo of either a Black child or a White child. After reading each story, participants provided a categorical veracity judgment by indicating whether they believed the child in the story was lying (and therefore committed the misdeed) or telling the truth (and was innocent), as well as rated how honest or deceptive the child was being on a continuous scale. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing their internal (personal) and external (normative) motivations to respond in non-prejudiced ways. Results and discussionResults indicated that systematic racial biases occur in adults' veracity judgments of children's statements. Both Black and White participants exhibited a truth bias in their veracity judgments of Black children, but not when evaluating the deceptiveness of White children. Consistent with the prejudice-related concerns hypothesis, the observed truth bias toward Black children was moderated by individual differences in participants' desire to respond without prejudice and whether those motivations stem from external or internal sources. The current findings present novel evidence regarding racial bias and prejudice-related concerns as potential barriers to making veracity judgments of children's statements and, ultimately, successful lie detection.

AB Latine students continue to persist in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields despite the numerous obstacles in place that stifle their academic potential and contributions. Instead of fostering the strengths Latine students possess that help them succeed despite these obstacles, the field of STEM education has traditionally examined these students' experiences and challenges through a deficit lens. Deficit perspectives posit that any existing disparities in educational outcomes in STEM for Latine students are a product of the students' lack of interest in STEM fields, poor academic preparation and/or motivation, among other 'faults.' In this manner, this deficit approach absolves educators, educational institutions, administrators, and researchers from any responsibility in mediating the disparate outcomes and negates the roles that outdated pedagogical practices, structural racism, discrimination and disciplinary bias have in limiting Latine students' success in STEM. These deficit-understandings of these inequities are pervasive in all aspects of STEM education, guiding curricular choices, pedagogical approaches, assessment designs, interventions and even how STEM fields define knowledge and success. To counter these harmful constructions, this article discusses how STEM educators can draw on Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) and Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) epistemologies to foster learning ecologies that draw on Latine students' cultural strengths rather than deficits. To this end, this article introduces LatCrit and CCW frameworks in the context of STEM education, and combines them to propose an asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approach to STEM curriculum design and teaching. It also contributes guiding questions and application examples STEM educators can reference to advance asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approaches that promote justice and equity within STEM classrooms and beyond. Contributing to this underdeveloped line of scholarship in the field of STEM, we apply these critical frames to help educators (re)imagine postsecondary STEM pedagogies and reforms around the wealth of skills, dispositions, and cultural practices that Latine students possess.

AB BackgroundWe present an analysis of interviews with 27 self-identified progressive white-male physics faculty and graduate students discussing race and gender in physics. White cis men dominate most STEM fields and are particularly overrepresented in positions of status and influence (i.e., full professors, chairs, deans, etc.), positioning them as a potentially powerful demographic for enacting systemic reform. Despite their proclaimed outrage at and interest in addressing inequity, they frequently engage in patterns of belief, speech and (in)action that ultimately support the status quo of white male privilege in opposition to their intentions.ResultsThe white male physicists we interviewed used numerous discourses which support racist and sexist norms and position them as powerless to disrupt their own privilege. We present and discuss three overarching themes, seen in our data, demonstrating how highly educated, well-intentioned people of privilege maintain their power and privilege despite their own intentions: (1) denying inequity is physically near them; (2) locating causes of inequity in large societal systems over which they have little influence; and (3) justifying inaction.ConclusionsDespite being progressively minded and highly educated, these men are frequently complicit in racism and sexism. We end with recommendations for helping cis men engage the power they hold to better work with marginalized people to disrupt inequity.

AB Storytellingin chemistry as a pedagogical tool provides an alternativelearning format for students to discover more about the people behindSTEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) innovationsthat impact our society. However, there is a dearth in the literatureon what influence storytelling pedagogy could have on STEM classroom.Our study examines the influence of storytelling as a pedagogicaltool on students' understanding of the importance of JDEI (Justice,Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) in a social seminar course withthe theme "Equity and History of Science." Our storytellingstudy has a small sample size with 13 students pursuing STEM majors.We describe the impact of screening four narrative films celebratingthe significant contributions of chemists Professor Alice AugustaBall, Dr. Saint Elmo Brady, Dr. Percy Lavon Julian, and Dr. BettyeWashington Greene in the social science seminar course. Our frameworkis aligned with Bell and Roberts' Storytelling Project (STP)Model, which focuses on creating a counter-storytelling communityand using various story types (stock stories, concealed stories, resistancestories, and emerging/transformative stories) for engagement. Ourstudy examined the complex interaction of many factors in the course,such as narrative films watched, student reflections on narrativefilms, in-class activities related to films and course readings, focusgroup interviews with students in the course, and an individual interviewwith the course instructor. Our results suggest that these films hada positive influence on all students in the course as it relates torepresentation in STEM, bridging of JDEI, and chemistry concepts.By learning about the stories of these chemists, it made learningmore engaging and realistic, and critical thinking thrived. We willalso discuss a practical example of how STEM faculty can use strategiesthat leverage popular films such as Marvel Studios' Black Panther, where the fictional element vibranium (Vb)is an important protagonist for student engagement in chemistry. Ourstudy has potentially global relevance for practice as it relatesto teaching pedagogy in STEM classrooms and the retention of studentsof color pursuing STEM majors.

AB This study examines the racialized and gendered experiences of Black men (N = 20) from elementary school through graduate school. The Black men featured in this article are current STEM doctoral students and were asked to reflect on their K-12 and undergraduate STEM experiences as well as their current experiences as graduate students. Findings conclude that Black men, as children and teens, experienced gendered racism in their STEM courses, which included a severe lack of racial representation of Black scientists, leading them to believe that they could not become scientists in their respective disciplines. At the undergraduate level, Black men encountered racial stereotyping and were self-conscious of their gender and race due to being underrepresented in their STEM courses. And at the doctoral level, Black men deal with psychological health issues due to the racism-related stressors they experience on campus, along with feeling compelled to be the spokesperson for Black students at their respective college campuses.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of Black doctoral students in music education in terms of their motivations to pursue doctoral studies, educational and social experiences while enrolled, and emerging information literacy. Qualitative techniques based on phenomenology were employed to document and better understand the experience of a small, purposive sample of Black doctoral students (n = 14) enrolled at universities throughout the United States. A variety of techniques ensured trustworthiness, including data triangulation, member checking, and use of an external interviewer. After data analysis, four core essences emerged: (a) Familial support and formative experiences during childhood, (b) Overload of information and frustration in conducting research, (c) Prejudice and lack of Black representation in the academy, and (d) Change-oriented motivations beset by barriers to access. Findings revealed commonalities in participants' lived experiences that could inform efforts to recruit and retain Black doctoral students, develop curricula that takes into account their experiences and goals, stem systemic racism, and promote equity and inclusion in the academy.

AB Racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes have persisted in the United States for decades, though the causes remain poorly understood. The life course perspective posits that poorer outcomes of Black birthing people stem from heightened exposure to stressors early in life and cumulative exposure to stressors over time. Despite its prominence, this perspective has seldom been investigated empirically. We analyzed longitudinal data gathered from 1319 women in low-income households in Wisconsin who received perinatal home visiting services. Variable- and person-centered analyses were performed to assess whether 15 adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and 10 adverse adult experiences (AAEs) were associated, alone and in combination, with pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and low birth weight among Hispanic (i.e., Latinx) and non-Hispanic Black and White participants. As expected, there were disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight, and both ACEs and AAEs were linked to poorer pregnancy and birth outcomes. Unexpectedly, bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that the associated effects of ACEs and AAEs were most robust for non-Hispanic White women. A latent class analysis produced four patterns of life course adversity, and multigroup latent class analyses confirmed that, compared to White women, higher-adversity class assignments were associated with less robust effects for Hispanic women, and even less robust effects for Black women. We discuss interpretations of the paradoxical findings, including the possibility that alternative sources of stress such as interpersonal and structural racism may better account for the reproductive disparities that disproportionately affect Black birthing people.

AB This paper describes the formation and ongoing effortsof a collaborativepartnership between students, faculty, and staff within the Chemistrydepartment at Amherst College. Formation of the group was inspiredby calls for structural, inclusive, change from students, faculty,and alumni. There are many benefits to collaborating across traditionalacademic hierarchies, and this report aims to show that these partnershipscan help identify avenues for the implementation of inclusive changein STEM departments. The Amherst College Chemistry community agreesthat graduates of the Chemistry department should leave the Collegewith a critical understanding of the implications of systemic discriminationas they pertain to chemical research and education; this paper sharesorganizational methods and strengths, as well as limitations and holisticreflections, of creating spaces for student, staff, and faculty partnershipto shape a STEM educational community. A specific outcome of thiscommittee was the creation of a diversity-equity-inclusion (DEI) requirementin the major. We share how CARAC helped the department arrive at thisdecision and discuss the departmental course, Chemistry in Society,that was developed in response.

AB Faith-based pregnancy centers strive to offer "alternatives to abortion" that supporters claim aid women and critics assert manipulate pregnant people, stigmatize abortion, and potentially delay clients from obtaining medical care. However, scholars know little about the exchanges within appointments and how clients make sense of these experiences. Drawing on ethnographic observations of client appointments in two pregnancy centers in the West and 29 in-depth interviews with clients, this article uses an intersectional framework to analyze client experiences. Clients favorably compared centers to clinical health care providers, emphasizing the unexpectedly attentive emotional care they received. These evaluations stem from clients' reproductive histories, which are shaped by gender, racism, and economic inequalities that configure their access to and interactions within the health system. Emotional care serves to create and maintain pregnancy centers' impression of legitimacy among clients.

AB Obesity disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and, most severely, Black persons with obesity.28 Health inequities affect many populations, including his-torically disadvantaged populations, persons living in rural areas, people with disabil-ities, and marginalized racial and ethnic groups.86 Many factors lead to this, including limited access to quality obesity care and socioeconomic factors, such as living in an obesogenic food environment or experiencing frequent microaggressions and racism, which can ultimately increase chronic stress and the development of obesity.7,86 Not surprisingly, these disparities in disease prevalence mirror similar inequality in access to quality obesity care and stem from many places, including poor access to care, inability to access quality obesity care with obesity-trained physicians and cli-nicians, and decreased rate of receiving official diagnosis obesity. Despite research supporting the use of lifestyle modification in addition to weight loss medications and surgery, when necessary, there is decreased utilization in persons with lower so-cioeconomic status or who are ethnic minorities. Some studies indicate that weight loss therapies and surgery are less effective in racial and ethnic minorities, but these disparities are likely repercussions of the unique challenges faced by minority communities1,28 With the growing number of individuals with obesity, there is an urgent need to address disparities in access and quality of care. Improving formal medical obesity education and health care policies that expand coverage for obesity care may also be an impactful intervention.16,17 With the varying efficacy of different dietary or sur-gery interventions, precision medicine needs to have a growing role in Obesity medicine.18

AB BackgroundWomen and people of color continue to be underrepresented in many STEM fields and careers. Many studies have linked societal biases against the mathematical abilities of women and people of color to this underrepresentation, as well as to earlier measures of mathematical confidence and performance. Recent studies have shown that teachers may unintentionally have biases that reflect those in broader society. Yet, many studies on teachers' reports of students' abilities use data in the field-not experimental data-and thus often cannot say if the findings reflect bias or actual differences. The few experimental studies conducted suggest bias against the abilities of girls and students of color, but the prior work has limitations, which we seek to address (e.g., local samples, no exploration of moderators, no preregistration).MethodsIn this preregistered experiment of 458 teachers across the U.S., we randomly assigned gender- and race-specific names to solutions to math problems, then asked teachers to rate the correctness of the solution, as well as the student's math ability and effort. Teachers also completed scales reflecting their own beliefs and dispositions, which we then assessed how those beliefs/dispositions moderated their biases. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nested data structure.ResultsConsistent with our preregistered hypotheses, when the solution was not fully correct, findings suggest teachers thought boys had higher ability, even though the same teachers did not report differences in the correctness of the solution or perceived effort. Moreover, teachers who reported that gender disparities no longer exist in society were particularly likely to underestimate girls' abilities. Although findings revealed no evidence of racial bias on average, teachers' math anxiety moderated their ability judgments of students from different races, albeit with only marginal significance; teachers with high math anxiety tended to assume that White students had higher math ability than students of color.ConclusionsThe present research identifies teachers' beliefs and dispositions that moderate their gender and racial biases. This experimental evidence sheds new light on why even low-performing boys consistently report higher math confidence and pursue STEM-namely, their teachers believe they have higher mathematical ability.

AB As the Hispanic/Latinx population in the United States continues to grow, disparities in health outcomes for this population continue to widen. Worse health outcomes can be attributed to a variety of barriers to healthcare specific to this population, but scant literature exists that presents the connections among them. Many of these barriers to healthcare stem from institutional racism, disparities in socioeconomic status, and xenophobia. To synthesize barriers that hinder the Hispanic/Latinx population from receiving quality healthcare, we propose a cyclical model. The model begins with obstacles present before even visiting a healthcare provider, including structural inequalities, cultural beliefs, documentation status, scheduling, and transportation. Next, the model poses barriers during the visit with a healthcare provider, including problems with provider bias, cultural barriers, and interpretation services. Finally, the model presents barriers that occur after the medical encounter, including payment, medication adherence, indigent care, and follow-up appointments or referrals. Once the patient needs to schedule a follow-up appointment or referral, the cycle restarts with the barriers present before accessing care. All of these barriers to healthcare are areas for potential mitigation of the healthcare disparities that currently disadvantage the Hispanic/Latinx population. The proposed Hispanic Cyclical Healthcare Barrier (HCHB) model helps organize solutions to the barriers, illustrating the need for multiple interventions due to the interconnectedness of the barriers.

AB Background: COVID-19 has spurred a global crisis that has disrupted everyday lives and impacted the traditional methods, experiences, and abilities of higher education institutions' students, faculty, and staff, especially at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).Purpose/Hypothesis: Given the pressing need demonstrated by the National Academies to advance the utilization of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HBCUs, this study aimed to explore the abrupt transition to remote teaching and learning at HBCUs guided by the following research question: How has COVID-19 impacted the success and persistence of engineering students, faculty, and staff at HBCUs?Design/Methods: Three surveys were developed, tested, piloted, and sent to HBCU stakeholders using a snowball sampling approach via email and social media outreach.Results: Of the 171 student respondents (126 engineering majors), 79% agreed that not being able to access faculty in person affected their academic performance. Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders' surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall levels of stress and anxiety.Conclusions: During a global pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence. Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic, the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward broadening participation in engineering for students should be further explored.

AB This mixed-methods study reports the results of a survey completed by a sample of Puerto Rican social and natural scientists (STEM-S) regarding their perceptions of the intersectionalities of racism, colorism, colonialism, and the culture of science. Most participants ranked themselves as light-skinned and were familiar with the racist stereotypes presented in the survey, with female participants reporting hearing racial stereotypes significantly more frequently than males. Dark-skinned Latinx scientists were more likely to experience discriminatory practices in general, in K-12 schools, and at meetings with colleagues or peers. The higher the professional level, the fewer the interactions with coworkers or peers who were darker-skinned. Power differences among lighter and darker-skinned scientists were attributed to systemic and covert racism, discrimination, and the influences of slavery and colonialism. Fostering anti-racist education in K-16 STEM courses, and more Black and Afro-descendant mentors and role models were suggested as ways to challenge racial inequities in STEM-S fields.

AB Self-determination aims to provide everyone the opportunity to sketch their life trajectories. Seemingly aspirational, paths are continuously influenced throughout childhood by both favourable and unfavourable factors. Natural environmental exposures have considerable impacts on development that give rise to transgenerational and community-wide consequences by influencing physical, emotional, and cognitive growth. Each interference can affect academic performance, the ability to reach one's full potential, and ultimately generational social mobility. The ongoing relationship between early development and hindered self-determination is particularly concerning for non-white and low-income communities in the United States, where children experience disproportionately poor environmental conditions. This paper discusses the multi-scalar effects that stem from such exposures to propose environmental justice efforts as the path toward protecting self-determination. Through reviewing human rights, environmental racism, and capability considerations, the paper illustrates how decades of research have cumulated to create a progression toward equity.

AB Against a backdrop of calls for increased access and participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the United States have emerged as critical access points for Latina/o/x and other Students of Color. Federal grants can become important levers for building institutional capacity for broadening participation in STEM and transforming HSIs toward better serving Students of Color, specifically as it relates to curricula and pedagogy. In this study, we focus on the engineering faculty at an HSI who are participants in a National Science Foundation-funded, equity-focused professional development program. Operationalizing Bonilla-Silva's color-evasive racial ideology framework, we use content analysis techniques to explore how engineering faculty discuss race and racism as part of the professional development experience. First, we find that engineering faculty largely rely on color-evasive racial frameworks (i.e., abstract liberalism, minimization of racism) when describing their motivations for participating in the program. Moreover, we find that engineering faculty responses depict a range of surprise and familiarity when reflecting on issues of race and racism. Finally, regardless of prior exposure to module concepts, at the end of the program, the majority of action projects reflect a recognition of race and racism as important.

Yet how instructors think about race and racism can impact whether and how they adopt inclusive practices. We examined how 39 undergraduate STEM instructors noticed anti-Black racialized events that were experienced by students in classroom narratives. We created narrative cases that described multiple common, harmful anti-Black racialized experiences based on extant research and guidance from an expert advisory board. Instructors responded to cases by describing the problems they noticed. Using frameworks of racial noticing and color-evasive racial ideology, we conducted qualitative content analysis of instructor responses. Color-evasive racial ideology was pervasive, with most responses (54%) avoiding any discussion of race, and few responses acknowledging race or racism in more than one event (10%). We characterized six forms of color-evasiveness. This study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that color-evasion is pervasive in STEM culture. Instructors would benefit from professional development that specifically aims to counter color-evasiveness and anti-Blackness in teaching. Furthermore, STEM disciplines must pursue systemic change so that our organizations value, expect, promote, and reward the development and enactment of a critical racial consciousness.

AB Geosciences remain one of the least diverse fields. Efforts to diversify the discipline need to address the role of hostile and exclusionary work and learning environments. A workplace climate survey distributed to five professional organizations illustrates varied experiences of earth and space scientists over a 12-month period (pre-COVID). A majority experienced positive interactions in the workplace. However, scientists of color, women and non-binary individuals, scientists with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, and asexual (LGBQPA+) scientists more frequently experienced negative interactions, including interpersonal mistreatment, discriminatory language, and sexual harassment. Geoscientists of color were more likely to experience devaluation of their work than white scientists. More than half of women and non-binary respondents, as well as those who identify as LGBQPA+ experienced identity-based discriminatory remarks. Disabled geoscientists were more likely to hear negative identity-based language than those who did not disclose a disability. Overall, 14% of all respondents experienced sexual harassment in the previous year. Rates were greatest for historically excluded groups: non-binary (51%), LGBQPA+ (33%), disabled (26%), women (20%), and geoscientists of color (17%). A majority of geoscientists reported avoiding their colleagues and almost a third considered leaving their institution or a career change. Historically excluded groups were more likely to report opting out of professional activities with potential career consequences. To address continued exclusion and low retention in the earth and space sciences, recruitment is not enough. We need to create environments that ensure opportunities for all to thrive.

TI Race-evasive frames in physics and physics education: Results from an
   interview study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BLACK-WOMEN; COLOR; STUDENTS; RACISM; FIX
AB Mainstream physics teaching and learning produces material outcomes that, when analyzed through the lens of Critical Race Theory, point to white supremacy, or "the systemic maintenance of the dominant position that produces white privilege" (Battey & Levya, 2016). In particular, the continued, extreme underrepresentation of People of Color in physics and a growing number of first-person accounts of the harm that People of Color experience in physics classrooms and departments speak to a system that valorizes whiteness and marginalizes People of Color. If we take Critical Race Theory as a lens, we expect that maintaining white supremacy in physics happens in part via discipline-specific instantiations of broader mechanisms that reproduce whiteness. In this study, we illustrate one such mechanism: race evasiveness, a powerful ideology that uses race-neutral discourse to explain away racialized phenomena, evading race as a shaping force in social phenomena. We offer examples from interviews with twelve university physics faculty, showing what race-evasive discourses can look like in physics and how physics epistemologies, discourses, and stories reify race-evasive frames. This work aims to support faculty in refusing race evasiveness in physics teaching and learning, toward developing race-conscious analyses that can help us challenge white supremacy in our discipline.

AB In the United States, most local jurisdictions are challenged as they seek to maintain fiscal strength. But majority-Black jurisdictions are uniquely burdened due to legacy and contemporary racist and racialized policies and racial capitalism. Leaders in majority-Black locales make harsher budget trade-offs than those in majority-White jurisdictions as they seek to invest in public schools and other public services. I use ethnographic and publicly available data to examine how Prince George's County, Maryland, a majority-Black and middle-class suburban jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C., region, navigates its financial constraints relative to neighboring counties with smaller Black populations. I conclude that Black jurisdictions' fiscal limitations stem from White jurisdictions' not bearing their proportionate share of responsibility for moderate-income and economically distressed households and fallout from uneven regional development, resulting in Black jurisdictions subsidizing White locales.

AB Purpose-This paper critiques how the member states adopted the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a concerted effort to improve the lives and meet the basic needs of all global citizens. COVID-19 has been an unexpected precipitous monitoring system that has exposed the current implemented policies and systems, begging the question, "are these goals failing? " Furthermore, may it be equated to failed leadership on a global scale? The UN 17 SDGs is an urgent call for union by all countries - developed and developing - recognizes that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality and spur economic growth. This paper is central to addressing the shortcomings of UN leadership and multilateral organizations. The UN coordinates multilateral organizations' actions in reaching the most marginalized communities (United Nations, 2015). Hence, these outcomes have become more distant to those without means and most in need, a likely consequence of program failure and our globalized world. The pandemic has taught us national solutions to global problems fall short and may only exacerbate the outcome. The authors approach this as a failure of global leadership. The UN's pledge to "Leave No One Behind " has undermined its commitment to poverty and inequalities of racism and sectarianism. The UN staff are often unprepared to deal with the issues they have contributed to. They continue to perpetuate the inequalities that stem from racism and discrimination even though the pledge is to leave no one behind. The 17 SDGs are designed to impact citizens' health and livelihood. The goals have direct and indirect effects on women, children and the most marginalized groups residing in urban cities across the globe. This article examines systemic racism and the UN and its impact on the SDGs' agenda.Design/methodology/approach-This article proposes a human-centered approach to address leadership inadequacies in a global public leadership institution using a literature review and contemporary cases.Findings-This article argues a premise for the UN institutions to adapt their leadership approaches to better understand the global communities with whom they serve.Practical implications-This article is directed to multi-lateral leaders and governments in hopes to expose inequities and hypocrisies in order to advance more inclusive and culturally responsive approaches to tackle the most challenging social issues the world faces.Originality/value-This article draws on current events of racism that challenge one of the largest global institutions and can potentially undermine the achievement of meeting the 2030 UN SDGs for any country.

AB How we teach human genetics matters for social equity. The biology curriculum appears to be a crucial locus of intervention for either reinforcing or undermining students' racial essentialist views. The Mendelian genetic models dominating textbooks, particularly in combination with racially inflected language sometimes used when teaching about monogenic disorders, can increase middle and high school students' racial essentialism and opposition to policies to increase equity. These findings are of particular concern given the increasing spread of racist misinformation online and the misappropriation of human genomics research by white supremacists, who take advantage of low levels of genetics literacy in the general public. Encouragingly, however, teaching updated information about the geographical distribution of human genetic variation and the complex, multifactorial basis of most human traits, reduces students' endorsement of racial essentialism. The genetics curriculum is therefore a key tool in combating misinformation and scientific racism. Here, we describe a framework and example teaching materials for teaching students key concepts in genetics, human evolutionary history, and human phenotypic variation at the undergraduate level. This framework can be flexibly applied in biology and anthropology classes and adjusted based on time availability. Our goal is to provide undergraduate-level instructors with varying levels of expertise with a set of evidence-informed tools for teaching human genetics to combat scientific racism, including an evolving set of instructional resources, as well as learning goals and pedagogical approaches. Resources can be found at https://noto.li/YIlhZ5. Additionally, we hope to generate conversation about integrating modern genetics into the undergraduate curriculum, in light of recent findings about the risks and opportunities associated with teaching genetics.

AB We have observed in recent years an acute polarization in Quebec on issues such as identity, secularism and the place of religion in public institutions, racism, etc. After recalling Edgar Morin's principles for studying complexity, we propose an epistemological/methodological reading of some of these controversies that concern Islam. We extend Morin's dialogical principle somewhat to address logics that are not part of the same system. The meeting of two processes that stem from different logics and that produce the same behavior has as a consequence, among others, to make it difficult to take completely coherent political positions. Political actors, favoring coherence rather than incoherence, tend to adopt a position of denial when faced with logics that produce meanings that are different from their own. The social conversation becomes then impossible. The principles proposed by Morin make it possible to conceive the necessarily paradoxical aspect of a given social phenomenon and open the door to a more nuanced discussion of the phenomenon.

AB The multibillion-dollar California cannabis (Cannabis sativa, marijuana) industry employs an unknown number of seasonal workers, including many immigrants. Most production occurs in the remote, rural, far-northern counties where farms may be hours by vehicle from the nearest town. While licenses for cannabis cultivation became available following legalization in California for adult recreational use in 2016, most cannabis- about 80%-is still grown on unlicensed farms. Cannabis is a labor-intensive crop, and the skilled and time-consuming task of hand-trimming flow-ers is the most common seasonal job in the indus-try. Some immigrant workers return for multiple cannabis harvest seasons and are attracted to the work by an interest in the cannabis culture and consumption or the opportunity to earn enough money in several months to live the rest of the year in their home country. Others are farmworkers moving from work in traditional crops for the rela-tively higher pay in the cannabis industry. Seasonal cannabis workers are exposed to many of the phys-ical hazards found in all agricultural workplaces, like dust, pesticides, and injuries; another common-ality with California's traditional agricultural work-force is vulnerability to structural violence stem-ming from factors related to race, gender, immigra-tion status, and employer/employee power imbal-ance. Cannabis workers are also uniquely affected by the intersections of these structural factors with the isolated and remote nature of cannabis farms and the ongoing criminalization of the industry. In this article we present the results of a qualitative study of the occupational health and safety of Mexican and South American immigrant seasonal cannabis workers who have previous cannabis -industry-specific skills and experience. Workers were recruited using a peer-recruitment method, with 25 participants in three online focus group discussions on a range of occupational health and safety topics. This qualitative descriptive analysis is focused on experiences of structural violence and wage theft.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important social determinant of health inequities that has been linked to chronic conditions, including osteoporosis, but research tends to focus on socioeconomic disadvantage rather than how socioeconomic advantage may facilitate these inequities. This study accounts for structural inequities and assesses the relationship between early-life and later-life SES, and risk of osteoporosis diagnosis. Data come from the nationally representative, population-based cohort Health and Retirement Study and include individuals ages 50 to 90. The outcome variable is osteoporosis diagnosis. Logistic regression models of the relationship between SES and osteoporosis diagnosis are estimated, accounting for demographic, health, and childhood variables. Higher levels of childhood and adult SES link to lower odds of osteoporosis diagnosis. Structural inequities in income and underdiagnosis of osteoporosis among persons identifying as Black/African American were detected. Accounting for bone density scan access, inequities in osteoporosis diagnosis appear to stem from barriers to accessing health care due to financial constraints. The important role of SES and evidence of structural inequities leading to underdiagnosis suggest the critical importance of clinicians receiving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training to reduce health inequities.

AB Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) service has been described as "cultural taxation," a burden or fee that historically excluded faculty unwillingly pay to the university without receiving benefit from their work. However, Baez argued that DEI service can also be a form of agentic resistance through which faculty rebuild more equitable universities. Previous framings, focused on outcomes of DEI service have obscured the fact that most of the work in DEI in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is being done by faculty who are themselves from historically excluded groups. Understanding DEI work as both a burden and a form of critical agency, I argue in this paper that we need to reframe DEI service in STEM as a type of institutional activism. After defining institutional activism, I introduce a DEI institutional activism framework based on the theory of collective iden-tity, which has previously been used to frame identity-based activism. I then describe four research trajectories that can be explored under this framework: (a) cognitive definitions of the means, aims, and environment of activist work; (b) the role of activist networks; (c) the impact of emotional in-vestment; and (d) the impact of social identity on engagement. Finally, I identify potential fruitful research questions that could be investigated under this framing and discuss how power dynamics impact this space.

DE race; racism; STEM programs; mathematics education
AB In this article, we present results of a research study in which we aimed to identify the experiences of students from Science, Technology, Engineer, and Mathematics (STEM) programs with racial microaggressions. The research participants were beneficiaries of affirmative action programs enrolled in these programs at the Federal University of Alfenas (n=390), who responded to a survey instrument called the Scale of Academic, Social, and Survival Experiences in the STEM (EASS-STEM). For the analysis, we used correlations, Spearman's test, chi-square significance test, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results indicate that students between the ages of 20 and 30 clearly identify aspects related to racial microaggressions. Additionally, self-identified Black students were the ones who experienced racial microaggressions more intensely, even surpassing the scores of self-identified mixed-race (Pardo) students, who also fall within the group of Black students in Brazil. This highlights that skin color is directly related to the experiences of racism and racial microaggressions faced by students. Despite overcoming the barrier of access, Black affirmative-action students from STEM programs continue to face the challenge of academic survival due to the structural violence they experience throughout their journey in the program and at the university.

AB This descriptive qualitative study used racialized organizations (Ray, 2019) as a lens to examine how 27 faculty, administrators, and postdoctoral fellows in STEM departments at two institutions understood the problems that underlie negative racial climate, the strategies they used to improve racial climate, and the alignment between problems and solutions. Participants did not discuss racism and White supremacy as factors that contribute to negative racial climate. Instead, they indicated a weak STEM pipeline, and lack of faculty engagement created negative climate. Because participants did not attend to how racism and White supremacy fostered negative climate, their strategies (e.g., increased recruitment, committees, workshops) left systemic racism intact and (un)intentionally amplified labor for racially minoritized graduate students and faculty champions who often led change efforts with little support. These findings can help move departments away from intervention-centered models of change and toward more systemic approaches that contest how racialized organizations operate.

AB International students make up an increasingly large portion of the US student population, especially among graduate students studying the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. This article analyzes the microaggression experiences of 22 international students in graduate STEM programs at predominantly white institutions. International students, often people of color, may be subject to facing discrimination within their universities. Our results break down the different types of microaggressions that 14 of our 22 participants reported experiencing from faculty, peers, and students, both on and off campus. These experiences include individuals insulting a participant's country of origin, doubting their academic ability, threatening them, and otherwise discriminating against them. Each event reported by our participants is classified into a type of microaggression and is further discussed using Critical Race Theory to connect how international students' racialized and their intersectional experiences are connected to the larger societal issues of racism in the US.

AB Women of Color (WoC) engineering faculty in higher education differ in their approaches to coping with inequities and salary disparities. This study draws upon McGee's Stereotype Management [McGee, E. O. 2016. "Devalued Black and Latino Racial Identities: A By-Product of College STEM Culture? " American Educational Research Journal 53 (6): 1626-1662; McGee, E. O. 2020a. Black, Brown, Bruised: How Racialized STEM Education Stifles Innovation.

"'We Need a Woman, We Need a Black Woman': Gender, Race, and Identity Taxation in the Academy. " Gender and Education 24 (2): 213-227] to understand how WoC in Engineering respond to race and gender-based salary disparity in engineering higher education. Results reveal that WoC contend with identity taxation that forces them to navigate gendered negotiation systems to achieve salary parity. The racial backgrounds of WoC appeared to influence how they managed the impacts of pay inequity. Stereotype management emerges as a form of identity taxation that WoC use to navigate their academic environments. Our research suggests that, rather than confronting their structural racism, institutions of higher education place the onus on scholars of colour to use strategies to protect themselves from the reality of race/gendered wage disparity.

AB BackgroundAlthough the clinical outcomes of patients with TP53-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are dismal, subsets of patients eligible for curative-intent therapies may fare better. Because racial disparities are known to affect outcome in hematologic malignancies, the authors sought to explore disparities among patients with TP53-mutated AML. MethodsA multicenter, retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of 340 patients who had TP53-mutated AML (275 non-Hispanic White [NHW] and 65 non-Hispanic Black [NHB]) to analyze differences in treatment and outcome among NHW and NHB patients. ResultsThe median patient age was comparable between NHW and NHB patients (p = .76). A higher proportion of NHB patients had therapy-related AML (31% vs. 20%; p = .08) and had co-mutations (74% vs. 61%; p = .06). A higher proportion of NHW patients received intensive chemotherapy compared with NHB patients (47% vs. 31%; p = .02). Conversely, a higher proportion of NHB patients received low-intensity chemotherapy (9% vs. 5.5%; p = .02) or best supportive care (22% vs. 7%; p < .001). The complete response rate (including complete responses with or without complete count recovery) was 31% versus 24.5% (p = .39) in NHW and NHB patients, respectively. Only 5% of NHB patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared with 15.5% of NHW patients (p = .02). The proportion of patients who were event-free (18.5% vs. 8.5%; p = .49) or who remained alive (24.9% vs. 8.3%; p = .13) at 18 months was numerically higher in NHW versus NHB patients, respectively, but was not statistically significant. ConclusionsThe current study highlights disparities between NHW and NHB patients with TP53-mutated AML. Efforts are warranted to eliminate treatment disparities in minority populations.

AB The documentary Picture a Scientist was adapted into a discussion-based laboratory assignment for organic chemistry students in an effort to open conversations about racism and gender-based harassment in STEM. The viewing of the documentary was scaffolded to prepare students to have a meaningful experience and to help manage and support distress from the viewing, if any. Students had different avenues to process their reflections after viewing the documentary, individually and in a group. The stories of the three scientists remind viewers that the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion has a negative impact on not only their work but also science in general. The students' discussions and reflections underscore the importance of incorporating environmental and social injustice issues into traditional chemistry curriculum and highlight the fundamental work members of the STEM community must engage in moving forward.

AB Background: The spread of unvetted scientific information about COVID-19 presents a significant challenge to public health, adding to the urgency for increased understanding of COVID-19 information-seeking preferences that will allow for the delivery of evidence-based health communication. This study examined factors associated with COVID-19 information-seeking behavior.Methods: An online survey was conducted with US adults (N = 1800) to identify key interpersonal (e.g., friends, health care providers) and mediated (e.g., TV, social media) sources of COVID-19 information. Logistic regression models were fitted to explore correlates of information-seeking.Results: Study findings show that the first sought and most trusted sources of COVID-19 information had different relationships with sociodemographic characteristics, perceived discrimination, and self-efficacy. Older adults had greater odds of seeking information from print materials (e.g., newspapers and magazines) and TV first. Participants with less educational attainment and greater self-efficacy preferred interpersonal sources first, with notably less preference for mass media compared to health care providers. Those with more experiences with discrimination were more likely to seek information from friends, relatives, and co-workers. Additionally, greater self-efficacy was related to increased trust in interpersonal sources.Conclusion: Study results have implications for tailoring health communication strategies to reach specific subgroups, including those more vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. A set of recommendations are provided to assist in campaign development.

AB The year 2020 was an awakening for some. For others, it reiterated the persistent social injustice in the United States. Compelled by these events, 30 diverse individuals came together from January to May 2021 for a semester-long seminar exploring inequity in archaeological practice. The seminar's discussions spotlighted the inequity and social injustices that are deeply embedded within the discipline. However, inequity in archaeology is often ignored or treated narrowly as discrete, if loosely bound, problems. A broad approach to inequity in archaeology revealed injustice to be intersectional, with compounding effects. Through the overarching themes of individual, community, theory, and practice, we (a subset of the seminar's participants) explore inequity and its role in various facets of archaeology, including North-South relations, publication, resource distribution, class differences, accessibility, inclusive theories, service to nonarchaeological communities, fieldwork, mentorship, and more. We focus on creating a roadmap for understanding the intersectionality of issues of inequity and suggesting avenues for continued education and direct engagement. We argue that community-building-by providing mutual support and building alliances-provides a pathway for realizing greater equity in our discipline.

AB BackgroundPreceded by a national media campaign, in May 2020, England switched to a soft opt-out system of organ donation which rests on the assumption that individuals meeting specific criteria have consented to organ donation unless they have expressed otherwise. We aimed to learn more about how the changes were communicated, how people responded and any discrepancies between key messages and how they were interpreted by the public. MethodsSummative content analysis of 286 stories and related reader-generated comments in leading UK online news sources (April 2019 to May 2021). Further detailed thematic analysis of 21 articles with reader-generated content, complemented by thematic content analysis coding of all 286 stories. ResultsMost media coverage on both organ donation and the law change was positive, with little variation over time or between publications. The importance of organ donation, benefits of the law change, and emotive stories (often involving children) of those who had donated an organ described as "superheroes" or those who had received organs as benefiting from a "miracle" were frequently cited. In contrast, reader-generated comments were markedly more negative, for example, focusing on loss of individual freedom and lack of trust in the organ donation system. Commentators wished to be able to choose who their organs were donated to, were dismissive and blaming towards minority ethnic groups, including undermining legitimate worries about the compatibility of organ donation with religious beliefs and end of life cultural norms, understanding and acceptance of brain-stem death and systemic racism. Misinformation including use of inflammatory language was common. ConclusionThe portrayal of donors and recipients as extraordinary is unlikely to help to normalise organ donation. Undermining legitimate concerns, in particular those from ethnic minorities, can alienate and encourage harmful misinformation in underrepresented groups. The discrepancies between the tone of the articles and the readers comments suggests a lack of trust across the public, health, policy and media outlets. Easily accessible, ongoing and tailored sources are needed to mitigate misinformation and disinformation and ensure key messages are better understood and accepted in order to realise the ambitions of soft opt-out organ donation policies.

AB Using Asian Critical Race Theory and Resilience Theory, this qualitative study explores how Asian international college students experienced racism before and after the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic and how they developed and used resilience to counteract that racism. Eleven Asian participants shared their counter-narratives through semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that, before the pandemic, participants were regularly subjected to racist acts and attitudes grounded in a deficit view of Asians that treated them as inscrutable foreigners, blamed them as individuals for perceived shortcomings in their home countries, dismissed their expertise outside of technical STEM fields, and failed to recognize their abilities in creative and leadership roles. During the pandemic, the racist acts and attitudes experienced by Asian international college students greatly exacerbated the unprecedented challenges of isolation, limited access to university space and resources, and financial and physical insecurity caused by the pandemic. Results also indicate that Asian international students developed resilience grounded on their life experiences and community assets to counteract racism.

AB Natural history, loosely defined as the observational study of organisms in the habitats where they occur, is recognized at the roots of ecology. Although the centrality of natural history in ecology has shifted over time, natural history is currently in resurgence: many again consider it to be the foundation of ecological and evolutionary inquiry and advocate the value of organism-centered approaches to address contemporary ecological challenges. Educators identify natural history as the foundational entryway into the practice of ecology, for example in the Ecological Society of America's Four-Dimensional Ecology Education (4DEE) framework. A strong natural history foundation can help generate testable hypotheses to refine mechanistic understanding of the drivers regulating species distributions and abundances and to inform restoration and conservation efforts. Given the resurgence of natural history as the foundation for ecological knowledge and practice, it is important to recognize that natural history has a long history of racism that has impacted ecological thought and priorities. This history shapes not only who conducts ecological science but also foundational ecological concepts. For example, natural history's emphasis on pristine nature untouched by humans disregards or appropriates stewardship and knowledge of most of the world's population. Because of the legacy of chattel slavery, this exclusion is particularly strong for people of African descent. This exclusion narrows ecological inquiry, limits the capacity to find solutions to ecological problems, and risks interventions that perpetuate the relation between eugenics, ecological knowledge, and natural systems. If ecology is to become an inclusive, responsive, and resilient discipline, this knowledge gap must be addressed. We here present the colonial and racist underpinnings of natural history and offer strategies to expand inclusion in the study of nature. Natural history was steeped in racism, providing a hierarchy of cultures and a taxonomy of races. Complementing growing interest in traditional and Indigenous ecological knowledge, we focus on Black ecological knowledge, for example in the study of "maroon ecologies. " Addressing the racist history of natural history is necessary for removing structural and racist barriers to diverse participation and expanding ecological knowledge bases in service of better and more just science.

AB The intersection of race and gender discrimination has resulted in the pervasive under-representation of women of color (WOC) in science careers, with research identifying that microaggressions are a key contributory factor to the imbalance. This study aims to compare individual experiences of microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations with institutional responses, thereby outlining the disconnects between the perspectives of minoritized scientists and those in positions of power. This paper draws on a constructivist paradigm to compare the experiences of women of color scientists with organizational representatives through 31 interviews conducted in science research organizations in the United Kingdom. The results find that organizational understandings of microaggressions differ substantially from those of WOC scientists. Furthermore, organizational responses favor policy-based solutions that fail to address the slippery and deniable nature of microaggressions. The paper concludes that, contrary to the more prevalent popular diversity initiatives, a greater belief in the testimony of WOC scientists amplified by institutional responses that empower their identity as scientists would be more effective strategies to reduce the sense of shame and isolation caused by subtle forms of discrimination.

AB In a two-page tenure letter, senior faculty can make or break a career. This power has an outsized impact on Black academics and other scholars with marginalized identities, who are awarded tenure at lower rates than their white colleagues. We suggest that this difference in tenure rates is due to an implicit, overly narrow definition of academic excellence that does not recognize all the contributions that Black scholars make to their departments, institutions and academia in general. These unrecognized contributions include the (often invisible) burdens of mentoring and representation that these scholars bear disproportionately. Here we propose a set of practical steps for writing inclusive, anti-racist tenure letters, including what to do before writing the letter, what to include (and not include) in the letter itself, and what to do after writing the letter to further support the candidate seeking tenure. We are a group of mostly non-Black academics in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) based in the United States who are learning about and working toward Black liberation in academia; we hope these recommendations will help ongoing efforts to move toward an inclusive academia that appreciates and rewards diverse ways of doing, learning and knowing.

AB This article presents an argument on the importance of teaching science with a feminist framework and defines it by acknowledging that all knowledge is historically situated and is influenced by social power and politics. This article presents a pedagogical model for implementing a special topic class on science and feminism for chemistry students at East Carolina University, a rural serving university in North Carolina. We provide the context of developing this class, a curricular model that is presently used (including reading lists, assignments, and student learning outcomes), and qualitative data analysis from online student surveys. The student survey data analysis shows curiosity about the applicability of feminism in science and the development of critical race and gender consciousness and their interaction with science. We present this work as an example of a transformative pedagogical model to dismantle White supremacy in Chemistry.

ID DISPARITIES
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in mental health treatment for people of color in the USA. Meeting the needs of those most burdened by this disparity will require swift and tactical action in partnership with these communities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a community-based participatory research approach was employed to assess the priorities and needs of four communities of color (African immigrant, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and Pacific Islander) in a major U.S. city. A brief quantitative survey devised jointly by community leaders and the research team was deployed to community members (N = 59) in the fall of 2020. The most endorsed mental health issues across the communities were excessive worry (51%) and stress regarding COVID-19, racism, and immigration policies (49%). The most endorsed physical health concerns included sleep difficulties (44%), headaches, and backaches (each 39%). Physical symptoms predicted the endorsement of a mental health issue above and beyond COVID-19-related hardships, multiplying the odds of reporting an issue by 1.73 per physical health concern endorsed. Based on these findings, the community-research team conceptualized and proposed an evidence-based, effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-2 intervention approach for chronic worry and daily stress. This paper highlights detail on how the community-research team arrived at the proposed multilevel intervention that addresses community-stated barriers to mental health treatment (e.g., preferring trusted health workers to deliver emotional health treatments) and considers the burden of the additional stressful context of COVID-19.
   Lay Summary Diverse community members and university researchers collaborated on the development of an equitable intervention approach for community members' mental health needs.

AB Women of color (WOC) continue to be underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where they often experience racism and sexism within disciplinary contexts that have historically privileged men and Whiteness. Participant narratives gained through focus-group and follow-up interviews illuminate the racialized and gendered STEM transfer experiences of 21 WOC who attended 2- and 4-year Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Using a multidimensional intersectional approach, we explore the interplay between the complex identity experiences of WOC and the dynamic intersections of their transfer pathways across 2- and 4-year HSIs and within STEM disciplinary contexts. Findings underscore the inequities that continue to pervade STEM and highlight opportunities for transforming disciplinary and institutional cultures, particularly within HSI STEM transfer pathways, where there is great potential for these diverse institutions to support, validate, and benefit from the unique contributions of WOC.

AB Indigenous Peoples are at an increased risk for infectious disease, including COVID-19, due to the historically embedded deleterious social determinants of health. Furthermore, structural limitations in Canadian federal government data contribute to the lack of comparative rates of COVID-19 between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. To make visible Indigenous Peoples' experiences in the public health discourse in the midst of COVID-19, this paper aims to answer the following interrelated research questions: (1) What are the associations of key social determinants of health and COVID-19 cases among Canadian health regions? and (2) How do these relationships relate to Indigenous communities? As both proximal and distal social determinants of health conjointly contribute to COVID-19 impacts on Indigenous health, this study used a unique dataset assembled from multiple sources to examine the associations among key social determinants of health characteristics and health with a focus on Indigenous Peoples. We highlight key social vulnerabilities that stem from systemic racism and that place Indigenous populations at increased risk for COVID-19. Many Indigenous health issues are rooted in the historical impacts of colonization, and partially invisible due to systemic federal underfunding in Indigenous communities. The Canadian government must invest in collecting accurate, reliable, and disaggregated data on COVID-19 case counts for Indigenous Peoples, as well as in improving Indigenous community infrastructure and services.

Using Latinx Critical Race Theory as a framework and through qualitative analyses of student assignments, we found that the course project developed students' critical consciousness by helping them evaluate how biographies are shaped by race, racism, and racial discourses and identify how racism and resistance manifest in family life through storytelling.

AB Understanding the psychological health of women of color (WOC) in a racialized and gendered society requires accessing, validating, and processing the lived experiences and emotions that stem from interlocking systems of oppression. Despite the importance of responding to the psychological health needs of this population, the group therapy literature on how to design and facilitate group therapy for women of color remains limited. For this reason, the present research aims to identify group therapy-oriented experiences based on data provided by ten women of color group psychotherapists practicing in the United States. Findings from the consensual qualitative research (Hill, 2012) revealed six domains: (a) group development, (b) personal and professional significance, (c) group facilitation behaviors, (d) perceived healing factors, (e) challenges, and (f) advice. Suggestions for future research and recommendations for women of color groups positioned as a wellspring of empowerment, liberation, and psychological health are also discussed.

AB While a strong literature base exists around undergraduate experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), few studies examine how students approach the question of "what's next" after graduation. This study examines the impact of social ties on STEM college seniors' plans to enter the STEM workforce, and how race/ethnicity and gender impact postgraduation planning in STEM. We interviewed a racially diverse sample of 39 STEM college seniors at a predominantly White research institution. Analysis showed that students relied on weak and strong social ties in obtaining job leads and valued diversity in the workplace. Some students of color and women experienced negative social ties (via racism and sexism) during internship experiences, which shaped their thinking around postgraduate opportunities. We discuss implications for equity, as well as recommendations for research and practice.

AB The experiences of Maori and Pacific postgraduate students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) offer insights into how universities, particularly science faculties, currently underserve Maori and Pacific people. This article shares the experiences of 43 current or past postgraduate students at New Zealand universities. Collectively, our stories offer insight into how representation, the white imprint, space invaders/stranger making, and institutional habits, specifically operate to exclude and devalue Maori and Pacific postgraduates in STEM. We provide new understandings of the white imprint (rewarding and incentivising white behaviour), where Maori and Pacific postgraduates were prevented from being their authentic selves. Importantly, this research documents how Maori and Pacific postgraduates experience excess labour because of institutional habits. This research also provides insight into how the science funding system results in superficial and unethical inclusion of Maori and Pacific postgraduates. Our stories provide persuasive evidence that the under-representation of Maori and Pacific in STEM will not be addressed by simply bolstering university enrolments. Instead, our stories highlight the urgent requirement for universities to change the STEM learning environment which continues to be violent and culturally unsafe for Maori and Pacific postgraduates.

DT Article
DE anthropology; family type; beliefs; culture; liberalism;
   authoritarianism; equality; ideology; religion; varieties of capitalism;
   homo economicus
AB Essay aims at a critical appraisal of the prominent contemporary French social thinker Emmanuel Todd's writings that explore constituent features of different family types and their psychological "worlds". By delineating economic, educational and family relations as belonging respectively to conscious, subconscious and nonconscious spheres he asserts that different family types produce distinctive sets of values that account for person's nonconscious preference for liberty versus authority, inequality versus equality etc. According to Todd to each type of family corresponds a particular ideology, political regime, religion etc. Thereby French sociologist provides original and rather unexpected insights into many social phenomena namely predisposition to liberalism, social democracy, communism, racism, xenophobia etc. Of a particular value is his elucidation of the anthropological roots of individualistic (American-type or absolute nuclear family) and coordinated (German and Japanese or stem family) capitalisms that sheds a new light on supposedly rather well documented story of the varieties of capitalism. However, in economic matters Todd is not always at his best. By describing homo economicus as a conscious but always acting in a framework of particular nonconscious family values, he somewhat blurs distinction between of conscious and nonconscious. In fact, he seems to have never been precise as to which - individual (personal) or collective (societal) - nonconscious family values modify person's economic performance. As he sharply criticizes Germany for imposing a stem family (austerity) type economic policy on EC, one may deduce that they interact at least at a national level. French thinker's theory critically depends on the thesis of an exceptional longevity of nonconscious family values, seemingly a rather questionable idea however supported by evidence. Even accelerating atomization of societies making family values' influence more subtle does not undermine the validity of this his central thesis. Todd' works are not without flaws but they are highly provocative, original and pathbreaking.

AB Women from racially/ethnically minoritized communities remain significantly underrepresented at all levels of education in STEM. The pervasive white and heteronormative culture of the STEM environment has contributed to Women of Color feeling isolated, hyper-visible, and invisible as they contend with racism, sexism, and gendered racial microaggressions. Scholars have found that counterspaces are key sites to support the persistence of Women of Color in STEM and ameliorate the negative psychological effects of navigating oppressive STEM milieus. Missing from the current literature is research on how counterspaces contribute to Women of Color's STEM persistence. This study sought to fill this gap in the literature by understanding the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color in the I CAN PERSIST STEM initiative, a multigenerational counterspace designed to support the holistic persistence of Women of Color in STEM. Steeped in the theoretical conceptualization of counterspaces, and using a case study methodological approach, we found that the multigenerational counter-storytelling and support from Women of Color in STEM, as well as the embodiment of holistic wellness, and justice-focused mentor-teaching supported STEM persistence intentions among undergraduate Women of Color in the sample. Furthermore, participants described being able to reconcile their STEM identities with their need to be active in addressing and mitigating the inequities in their communities, while also prioritizing their well-being and rejecting the STEM culture of overwork and burnout.

AB For some time, scholars who are guided by critical theories and perspectives have called out how white supremacist ideologies and systemic racism work to (re)produce societal inequities and educational injustices across science learning contexts in the United States. Given the sociopolitical nature of society, schooling, and science education, it is important to address the racist and settled history of scientific disciplines and science education. To this end, we take an antiracist stance on science teaching and learning and seek to disrupt forms of systemic racism in science classrooms. Since teachers do much of the daily work of transforming science education for minoritized learners, we advocate for preparing teachers who understand what it means to engage in antiracist, justice-oriented science teaching. In this article, we share our framework for supporting preservice teachers in understanding, developing, and implementing antiracist teaching dispositions and instructional practices. In alignment with other researchers in teacher education who emphasize the importance of anchoring teacher education practice and research in prominent educational theory, we highlight the theories undergirding our approach to antiracist science teaching. We offer considerations for how researchers and science teacher educators can use this framework to transform science teacher education.

AB Research shows student success in advanced-level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs is connected to future educational and economic opportunities. Yet, Black students have been excluded from participating in rigorous mathematics courses that prepare them to engage in STEM majors and careers. This article reviews research on Black student mathematics participation at the pre-college, post-secondary, and professional levels. Three systemic barriers to Black student participation are limited access, limiting mindsets and beliefs, and lack of support. Eliminating these barriers can result in an increase in Black students' enrollment, persistence, and achievement in advanced mathematics courses. The article provides strategies proven successful in urban contexts to ensure equitable learning environments that maximize the full potential of Black students. Educational leaders must address systemic inequities rooted in racism, purposefully engage Black students in rigorous and extended learning opportunities, and provide them with peer and faculty support.

AB Background Calculus instruction is underexamined as a source of racialized and gendered inequity in higher education, despite research that documents minoritized students' marginalizing experiences in undergraduate mathematics classes. This study fills this research gap by investigating mathematics faculty's perceptions of the significance of race and gender to calculus instruction at a large, public, historically white research university. Methods Theories of colorblind racism and dysconsciousness guided a critical discourse analysis of seven undergraduate calculus faculty's perceptions of instructional events. Findings Our analysis revealed two dominant discourses: (i) Race and gender are insignificant social markers in undergraduate calculus; and (ii) Instructional events can be objectively deemed race- and gender-neutral. We illustrate how calculus faculty varyingly engaged these colorblind discourses as well as discourses that challenged such conceptions of instruction. We also highlight how faculty dysconsciousness in reports of instructional practices reflect potential operationalization of dominant discourses that reinforce colorblind racism. Contribution With limited research on faculty perspectives on racial equity in mathematics, our study documents how color-evasive, gender-neutral discourses among mathematics faculty shape orientations to instruction that reinforce the gatekeeping role of calculus in STEM higher education. Implications are provided for race- and gender-conscious undergraduate mathematics instruction and faculty development.

AB Undergraduate calculus instruction is a contributor to racialized and gendered trends of STEM persistence and disidentification with mathematics. However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students' perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices - instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) - were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants' perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students' experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked. We conclude with implications for practice and research.

AB OBJECTIVES: Racial/ethnic disparities in utilizing inpatient palliative care services are well documented in the adult literature. However, the impact of racial/ethnic disparities in the context of pediatric palliative care is less well understood even in high-acuity patient populations such as stem cell transplant patients. We investigated racial/ethnic differences in the utilization of inpatient palliative care consultations (IPCCs) for pediatric stem cell transplant patients. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Pediatric Health Information System database. A generalized linear mixed effects model was developed to assess demographic and clinical characteristics associated with the likelihood of receiving IPCC. SETTING: Thirty-eight tertiary pediatric hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for any indication from January 2017 to December 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1,193 inpatient encounters studied, 12% (n = 143) included a palliative care consult. IPCC rates varied across hospitals with a median rate of 5.97% (interquartile range, 0.00-20.71). In multivariable analyses, Hispanic/Latinx patients were 59% less likely to receive IPCC compared with non-Hispanic White patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.78). This difference persisted after adjusting for all other sociodemographic and clinical factors. In terms of the other clinical characteristics, having a malignant condition and mechanical ventilation were associated with significantly increased odds of receiving IPCC for the entire cohort (OR Malignancy: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07-3.51; OR Mechanical Ventilation: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.36-4.13). The remainder of the variables were not found to be significantly associated with IPCC. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences exist in the likelihood of receiving palliative care consultations among hospitalized pediatric stem cell transplant recipients. Evaluating the impact of systemic racism and social determinants on palliative care medicine as well as standardizing early integration of IPCC may potentially mitigate disparities in this population.

AB Black queer undergraduates experience invisibility at the juncture of anti-Black racism and cisheteropatriarchy in their campus environments. With the absence of research on queer students of color in undergraduate STEM, it has been unexplored how Black queer invisibility is reinforced and disrupted in uniquely racialized and cisheteronormative STEM spaces. Drawing on Black queer studies and a proposed framework of STEM education as a White, cisheteropatriarchal space, our study addresses this research gap by exploring four Black queer students' experiences of oppression and agency in navigating invisibility as STEM majors. A counter-storytelling analysis reveals how curricular erasure and within-group peer tensions shaped variation in undergraduate Black queer students' STEM experiences of invisibility. Findings inform implications for education research, practice, and policy.

AB Diversity initiatives are designed to help workers from disadvantaged backgrounds achieve equitable opportunities and outcomes in organizations. However, these programs are often ineffective. To better understand less-than-desired outcomes and the shifting diversity landscape, we synthesize literature on how corporate affirmative action programs became diversity initiatives and current literature on their effectiveness. We focus specifically on work dealing with mechanisms that make diversity initiatives effective as well as their unintended consequences. When taken together, these literature point to several inequality-specific omissions in contemporary discussions of organizational diversity initiatives, such as the omission of racial inequality. As we contend in the first section of this review, without affirmative action law, which initially tasked US employers with ending racial discrimination at the workplace, we would not have diversity initiatives. We conclude by providing directions for future research and elaborating on several core foci that scholars might pursue to better (re)connect issues of organizational diversity with the aims of equity, equality and social justice.

AB The Higher Education attainment gap between BAME students and their White peers is well documented. The cause of this gap is multifactorial, and there is a need to understand contributing factors to support the design of meaningful interventions. This study aimed to probe student and staff understanding of what contributes to the attainment gap and to collect feedback on how to reduce it. Qualitative data were collected from 110 STEM students (95% BAME and 75% female) and 20 staff (70% BAME and 80% female) from Universities in the West Midlands and London via one-to-one interviews and focus groups. Questions were developed across themes of support, inclusivity, and development. Transcripts were subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Key findings included: the need for cultural awareness and representation within student support services and pastoral care provision and tailored support for students who were the first in their families to attend university. Students also felt the academic staff disproportionally represent their backgrounds, leading to a sense of not belonging amongst BAME students. BAME staff felt like tokens for diversity and reported having higher workloads than White staff, the social drinking culture felt isolating, participants felt that all staff should engage with cultural/religious training and diversity of academic staff should be improved through inclusive recruitment practices and mentoring. The results highlight the need for access to academic and pastoral support that is culturally sensitive to all backgrounds.

AB Racism and bias are pervasive in society-and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are not immune to these issues. It is imperative that we educate ourselves and our students about the history and consequences of this bias in STEM, investigate the research showing bias toward marginalized groups, understand how to interpret misuses of science in perpetuating bias, and identify advances and solutions to overcome racism and bias throughout our professional and personal lives. Here, we present one model for teaching a universal course for participants of all professional stages to address these issues and initiate solutions. As very few institutions require students to enroll in courses on racism and bias in STEM or even offer such courses, our curriculum could be used as a blueprint for implementation across institutions. Ultimately, institutions and academic disciplines can incorporate this important material with more region and/or discipline specific studies of bias.
   The authors present one model for teaching a universal course for participants of all professional stages to address racism, bias, and exclusion in STEM, and discuss the literature around these issues and why it is important to teach courses like these.

AB Latina women and other ethnic and racial groups continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including public health. This underrepresentation of people from diverse backgrounds and lived experiences in academic public health and other scientific disciplines is a form of epistemic oppression, exclusion that hinders contribution to knowledge production and advancement. Our analysis of 2021 data from the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health indicates that Latinos/as represented only 6.0% of all instructional faculty and 6.1% of all tenured faculty at schools and programs of public health. We discuss the ways in which sociopolitical contexts, family-level dynamics and gendered norms, and institutional contexts hamper Latinas' full participation in academia. We propose solutions such as redefining metrics for success, leadership accountability, equity analyses, cluster hiring initiatives, and instituting structured mentoring and leadership programs. Bold actions are needed if we are to advance the scientific enterprise and address the diversity and equity problem in public health.

AB Scholars across disciplines and throughout PK-20 education have argued that color-blind ideology works to perpetuate racial inequities in education via policies, research, curriculum, instruction, and student-teacher interactions. This study explores an underexamined issue in relation to color-blind ideology in STEM education. Specifically, it examines how a sample of college science faculty members use color-blind framings to make sense of the underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students in their fields. Interviews were conducted with 42 professors (majority tenured/ tenure-track, white, male, and continuing generation to college) in a College of Sciences at a research-intensive, historically white institution in the United States. Thematic analysis showed that while many faculty members implicated systemic racism in their sense making about the underrepresentation of racially minoritized students in STEM, the majority used colorblind frames (abstract liberalism, cultural racism, and minimization of racism) by focusing on individual behaviors and choices, cultural deficits, under-preparation, and poverty. Consistent with the research on color-blind ideology, professors were able to explain racial phenomena without implicating race/racism, which allowed them to absolve themselves from responsibility in addressing racial inequality issues in higher education. Faculty members who made sense of underrepresentation through systemic racism framings tended to recognize that they had a role to play in ameliorating these issues for students of color. These findings have implications for future research and professional development efforts.

AB Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have higher mortality rates than non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients despite more favorable genetics and younger age. A discrete survival analysis was performed on 822 adult patients with AML from 6 urban cancer centers and revealed inferior survival among NHB (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.22) and Hispanic (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.79) patients compared with NHW patients. A multilevel analysis of disparities was then conducted to investigate the contribution of neighborhood measures of structural racism on racial/ethnic differences in survival. Census tract disadvantage and affluence scores were individually calculated. Mediation analysis of hazard of leukemia death between groups was examined across 6 composite variables: structural racism (census tract disadvantage, affluence, and segregation), tumor biology (European Leukemia Network risk and secondary leukemia), health care access (insurance and clinical trial enrollment), comorbidities, treatment patterns (induction intensity and transplant utilization), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission during induction chemotherapy. Strikingly, census tract measures accounted for nearly all of the NHB-NHW and Hispanic-NHW disparity in leukemia death. Treatment patterns, including induction intensity and allogeneic transplant, and treatment complications, as assessed by ICU admission during induction chemotherapy, were additional mediators of survival disparities in AML. This is the first study to formally test mediators for observed disparities in AML survival and highlights the need to investigate the mechanisms by which structural racism interacts with known prognostic and treatment factors to influence leukemia outcomes.

AB Background: To stem the tide of teacher turnover and prevent shortages, teacher turnover interventions and policies often focus on new and novice teachers because evidence suggests that teacher turnover is particularly high among these teachers. In addition, researchers continue to investigate the root causes of the high teacher turnover observed in many low-income, high-minority schools and whether this is due more to school demographics or poor working conditions. Purpose: This article examines New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) teachers' risk of leaving their first school in their first 9 years. It both describes the patterns in leaving and examines how school demographics and school climate predict these leaving patterns. Participants: The study follows 608 teachers: two cohorts of secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers who entered the classroom in New York City in 2006 or 2007. Research Design: This is a quantitative study of survey and retention data that were collected as part of a longitudinal research project on NYCTF mathematics teachers. Data Analysis: We use an event history analysis (including a life table and hazard function graphs) to describe patterns in teachers' timing of leaving their first school. We also use a discrete time hazard model to estimate the relative relationships between the predictors of interest (school demographics and school climate) and teacher turnover. Results: The findings from this study provide evidence against the general hypothesis in the field that teachers leave their first schools at the highest rate during their first 1 to 3 years. Second, we also found that the turnover of alternatively certified teachers who began in low-income, high-minority urban schools was driven by both student demographics and school climate conditions, including teacher collegiality and student behavior. Third, we found evidence to support our hypothesis that teachers' individual perceptions of their school environment are stronger drivers of their turnover compared with the perceptions of their colleagues. Conclusion: The results from this study add to our understanding about the timing of teacher turnover among secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers, illustrating that teacher turnover may remain higher later in beginning teachers' careers than currently assumed. This suggests that teachers in Years 3 to 5 in their careers may be good targets for supports. Our findings support the theory that improving school climate can help retain teachers but also provide a cautionary tale for a complete focus on school climate; stemming teacher turnover may require addressing larger economic forces (e.g., the global trend toward temporary work) and more insidious social forces, such as structural racism and inequality.

AB Infertility can affect anyone, including Black women who, contrary to popular belief, are most likely to suffer from infertility, less likely to seek fertility care, and more likely to delay or completely forgo fertility treatment (Chin et al Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol 29(5):416-25, 5). These trends are likely fueled by deep-rooted stigma generated from a multitude of origins. Some black women may feel uncomfortable discussing their experience with infertility due to the pervasive stereotype that Black women are hyper-fertile (Ceballo et al Psychol Women Q 39(4):497-511, 20). This stereotype also has important implications within the medical field, in which provider implicit bias may affect referrals and treatment plans, further contributing to stratified reproduction (Chapman et al J Gen Intern Med 28(11):1504-10, 15, FitzGerald and Hurst BMC Med Ethics 18(1):19, 16). It is time for the medical community to shift our focus to what we can change, starting with how we perceive the narrative. In order to effect change, providers should first become and remain aware of racial/ethnic disparities within reproduction. We can make a concerted effort to effectively counsel Black women about their fertility and future childbearing goals, as well as strive to debunk false racial/ethnic fertility stereotypes with medical evidence. We should actively work to understand our biases, where they stem from, and how to resolve them. We must aim to always provide respectful, equitable, and consistent care, especially when deciding how to counsel someone regarding fertility preservation and infertility treatment options. In sum, we can approach solving this complicated racial-ethnic gap in health equity by taking small intentional and parallel steps, starting now.

AB Contribution: The present research provides new evidence on the predictors of foreign-born (FB) students' dropout and the situations of discrimination that emerge on engineering campuses. Background: Ethnic minority students remain underrepresented in engineering degrees and have higher dropout rates than their White peers. Previous literature pointed out discrimination as a possible cause of these disparities. However, little is known about the factors that trigger these discriminations and to which extent discrimination can predict students' dropout. Knowing this information will help institutions and governments establish support plans for underrepresented students to increase their participation in engineering degrees. Research Questions: 1) Do native-born (NB) and FB students enrolled in engineering degrees differ in their levels of academic satisfaction, self-esteem, perceived discrimination, and dropout intentions? 2) What factors predict the likelihood that FB students would drop out of engineering degrees? 3) What main factors make FB students feel discriminated against on engineering campuses? Methodology: A sample of 602 undergraduate engineering students answered a questionnaire, and descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Findings: FB students reported significantly lower self-esteem than NB students. Contrary to what was expected, FB students did not report significantly higher dropout intentions and perceived discrimination than NB students; possible reasons are discussed. Academic satisfaction, self-esteem, and perceived discrimination were significant predictors of FB students' dropout intentions, with perceived discrimination being the strongest predictor in students most at risk of dropping out. Finally, the study identifies the most relevant reasons, situations, and people causing discrimination on engineering campuses.

AB We show that Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests shift public discourse toward the movement's agenda, as captured by social media and news reports. We find that BLM protests dramatically amplify the use of terms associated with the BLM agenda throughout the movement's history. Longitudinal data show that terms denoting the movement's theoretically distinctive ideas, such as "systemic racism," receive more attention during waves of protest. We show that these shocks have notable impact beyond intense, or "viral," periods of nationwide protest. Together, these findings indicate that BLM has successfully leveraged protest events to engender lasting changes in the ways that Americans discuss racial inequality.

AB Though Filipinx Americans continue to face high rates of suicide compared to their ethnic and racial counterparts, a culturally sensitive model that considers their unique Indigenous values and distinct sociocultural history has not yet been developed. This article decolonizes the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) for use with Filipinx American clients. Culturally responsive strategies for counseling, community outreach, and research with Filipinx Americans who may be at risk for suicide are also outlined.
   What is the public significance of this article? Filipinx Americans may be at higher risk for suicide because of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability that may stem from their unique Indigenous values and experiences of discrimination across multiple communities. This article decolonizes the ITS model and presents specific strategies for counseling, community outreach, and research with Filipinx Americans at risk for suicide.

ID ATTITUDES
AB This article is in response to and in broad support of Philip Ewell's keynote talk, "Music Theory's White Racial Frame/' given at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Society for Music Theory, and essay, "Music Theory and the White Racial Frame" (2020a). In his address and its companion essay, Ewell notes how the repertoire we study and teach, as well as the theories we use to explain it, are manifestations of whiteness. My article will show, first, that the repertory used in the development of theories of harmony and form, as well as (and especially) music theory pedagogy comprises a small, unrepresentative corpus of pieces from the so-called "common practice period" of tonal music, mostly the music of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and only a small subset of their output. We (mis)use this repertory due to a combination of implicit biases that stem from our enculturation as practicing musicians, explicit biases that stem from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of "great" composers and particular "masterworks," and confirmation biases that are manifest in our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when developing and demonstrating our theories. The theories of harmony and form developed from this small corpus further suffer from overfi ing, whereby theoretical models are overdetermined relative to the broader norms of a musical practice, and from our tendency to conceive of our theoretic models in terms of tightly regulated "scripts" rather than looser "plans." For these reasons, simply expanding our analytic and/or pedagogical canon will do little to displace the underlying aesthetic and cultural values that are bound up with it. We must also address the biases that underlie canon formation and valuation and the methodologies that inherently privilege certain pieces, composers, and repertoires to the detriment of others. It is thus argued that working toward greater equity, diversity, and inclusion in music theory goes hand in hand with addressing some of the problematic methodologies that have long plagued our discipline.

AB The recent anti-racist movements in the United States have inspired a national call for more research on the experiences of racially marginalized and minoritized students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As researchers focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, we contend that STEM education must, as a discipline, grapple with how analytic approaches may not fully support equity efforts. We discuss how researchers and educational practitioners should more critically approach STEM equity analyses and why modifying our approaches matters for STEM equity goals. Engaging with equity as a process rather than a static goal, we provide a primer of reflective questions to assist researchers with framing, analysis, and interpretation of student-level data frequently used to identify disparities and assess course-level and programmatic interventions. This guidance can inform analyses conducted by campus units such as departments and programs, but also across universities and the scientific community to enhance how we understand and address systemic inequity in STEM fields.

AB This chapter presents a broad interdisciplinary literature review linking artists' economic precarity and need for but resistance to entrepreneurial skills, alongside colonial histories, structural racism, and hierarchies of taste in arts organizations. These themes are complemented empirically by engaging data from the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP) to demonstrate indicators of attrition and privilege of arts alumni relative to their participation in the arts workforce. Meaningfully different associations across racial/ethnic groups are uncovered, showing structural exclusion of Black arts alumni in particular, in addition to other intersectional dynamics. This chapter underscores the importance of addressing student debt, the potential of creative pedagogies across the curriculum, and the need for imaginative approaches to renewed public funding of art and artists.

ID PEDAGOGY; TEACHER; IMPACT
AB There is a sense of urgency among P-12 educators to dismantle systemic school-based racism and radically transform conditions for teaching and learning in ways that advance equity, social justice, and social-emotional learning (SEL). This transformation cannot be achieved through typical top-down, short-term approaches to school improvement or professional development. In this article we explain how, in an urban school district working to bring Digital Literacy and Computer Science (DLCS) to all students, robust professional learning communities (PLCs) have been leveraged to redress racism and led to changes in teacher mind-sets, more equitable classroom practices, and positive social-emotional learning outcomes. We explain how routine school improvement initiatives, such as stand-alone professional development events, fail to address racist beliefs and behaviors, and are inadequate to the task of advancing SEL. We describe the attributes and outcomes of effective PLCs, including the effects that PLC participation may have on teacher capacity to make anti-racist changes to curriculum and instruction, and advance the social, emotional, and academic learning of all students.

AB Racism remains a root cause of underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx scholars across STEM. It also contributes to a lack of diversity in science communication, the types of science stories that are told, and the communities science communicators seek to engage. Racism is omnipresent in STEM, from education to research to science communication (SciComm), because STEM institutions operate within a culture systematically privileging Whiteness, i.e., a White supremacy culture (WSC), that dictates the norms and practices that most in these fields heedlessly accept and replicate. In this Perspective, we acknowledge the ways in which SciComm and SciComm training perpetuate WSC and examine how SciComm trainers can use their power to dismantle it. SciComm trainers pioneer new methods of sharing ideas and influence the culture of STEM, so are uniquely situated to bring about systemic change to address these problems in SciComm, STEM, and society, starting with four core themes for action: (1) Authentic Interrogation, Acknowledgment, and Accountability; (2) Representation; (3) Culturally Responsive Practice; and (4) Inclusion. We also describe our current work, which builds upon the Key Traits of Inclusive SciComm identified by leaders in the field, to co-create a framework to guide authentic, culturally competent, and inclusive SciComm. The draft framework integrates the Key Traits across spheres of influence (e.g., self, interpersonal, community, institution, society: politics and culture), with the ultimate goal of using SciComm to supplant WSC across these spheres of influence, with new cocreated norms centering minoritized scholars, science communicators, and audiences in STEM.

DT Article
ID MECHANICAL TURK; IMPLICIT; NORMS; METAANALYSIS; ATTITUDES; RACISM
AB The presidency of Donald Trump represented a relatively unique event in modern American history, whereby a sitting US president made numerous controversial remarks about minoritized groups yet nonetheless maintained substantial public support. Trump's comments constituted a departure from the egalitarian norms that had long characterized American political discourse. Here, we examine the potential effects of Trump's rhetoric on Americans' attitudes, predicting that these high-profile norm violations may have reshaped the personal prejudices of the American people. In 13 studies including over 10,000 participants, we tested how Americans' prejudice changed following the political ascension of Donald Trump. We found that explicit racial and religious prejudice significantly increased amongst Trump's supporters, whereas individuals opposed to Trump exhibited decreases in prejudice. Further, changing social norms appear to explain these changes in prejudice. These results suggest that Trump's presidency coincided with a substantial change in the topography of prejudice in the United States.
   Ruisch and Ferguson examine changes in prejudice in the United States during Trump's presidency. They find both increases in prejudice amongst Trump's supporters and decreases amongst those opposed to Trump, changes that seem to stem from perceived social norms.

AB Background Repeated calls to diversify the population of students earning undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields have noted the greater diversity of community college students and their potential to thus have an impact on the racial/ethnic composition of 4-year degree earners. In this paper, we investigate barriers and supports to Black women's success in STEM, using longitudinal interview data with seven Black women who were enrolled at community colleges and stated an interest in majoring in STEM at 4-year institutions. Results Our findings highlight a contrast between community colleges and universities. At community colleges, Black women were able to form supportive relationships with professors and peers, downplayed the potential of racism and sexism to derail their STEM ambitions, and saw little to no impact of bias on their educational experiences. Those students who transferred characterized university climates very differently, as they struggled to form supportive relationships and experienced racism and sexism from professors and peers. Conclusions We conclude using Patricia Hill Collins' Domains of Power framework to categorize students' experiences, then end with recommendations for change that will result in less alienating experiences for Black women, among other minoritized students.

AB In this paper, we share an approach to address systemic racism by highlighting a research-practice partnership [RPP] effort between a university and STEM program (I AM STEM) to understand the extent to which centering abolitionist teaching and emancipatory practices in a science methods course supported teacher candidates' virtual microteaching experiences. This study's conceptual framework put research-practice partnership in conversation with abolitionist teaching (Love, 2019) and community cultural wealth to explore access to STEM teaching and learning. We highlight the experiences of four secondary science teacher candidates through an embedded single case study. Data sources included observation field notes, microteaching reflections, semi-structured individual interviews, and lesson plans, which were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory approaches. Findings revealed that the teacher candidates embraced the concept of abolitionist teaching to inform their microteaching experiences by leveraging social justice standards and emancipatory pedagogies. The participants developed science lessons that honored students' cultural capital through critical readings, discussions, and reflections. Furthermore, the RPP between I AM STEM and the partnering university provided supports to contextualize and humanize science learning for Black and Brown children in online learning spaces. To expose and dismantle racism in science education, we must reimagine our science teacher preparation programs and courses. Thus, emancipating STEM education means engaging in the struggle toward humanity and collective healing. Abolitionist teaching within the context of science education does not require another reform effort. To disrupt systemic oppression, we must demand restorative justice and engage in direct transformative action.

AB This paper calls for a critical reimagination of science epistemology and praxis by advocating for a move toward Black liberation in and through K-12 science education. This call is driven by our desires as authors to foster a future of K-12 science teaching and learning that centers, embraces, and promotes historical and contemporary Black scientific innovation and creativity through practices that redress structural anti-Black racism and its implications on Black existence and life. Black Liberatory K-12 Science Education (BLKSE) names the existing challenges with cultivating and empowering Black minds in and through science as a result of anti-Black ideologies that ground and govern K-12 science access, teaching and learning. In naming said challenges as the manifestations of anti-Black ideologies, we shed light on the roles of K-12 science teachers and science teacher education regarding the treatment of Black students given oppressive policies and practices that fail to recognize Black brilliance and innovation. By advocating for a push toward BLKSE, we offer guiding concepts we feel are necessary to begin the process of rooting out anti-Blackness; a process that centers a holistic, heterogenous form of Blackness at the crux of science inquiry and understanding. As a result of this perspective, BLKSE embraces the beauty and creativity of Black youth, naming their positions and ideas as forms of scientific knowledge and inquiry, while disrupting existing mainstream paradigms and practices in science education. Implications for ways to work toward BLKSE in K-12 science teaching and teacher education are provided.

AB In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the rapid emergence of vaccines, the dual benefits of both science and technology have been lauded, while dominant, deficit-based narratives of vaccine hesitancy and mistrust in science and medicine by the general public, particularly minoritized populations, run rampant. In this paper, we argue for a counternarrative, where instead of erroneously positioning communities of color as the problem, the problem is reframed to consider what the scientific, technological, and science education communities need to do to become more trustworthy and transgress the persistent shortcomings related to racism and injustice. Specifically, in this position paper, we (a) discuss the interactions of science, technology, and society from the perspective of the nature of technology; (b) engage an understanding of how bias, access, and racism operate in and at the intersection of science, technology, and technological systems; (c) discuss implications of these ideas in science education; and finally (d) pose recommendations to counter alienation and racism with an emphasis on a sixth dimension, equitable, social justice criticality, for science-technology education. In conclusion, we make recommendations by centering a more equitable, social justice criticality of science and technology.

AB Black and Brown communities are affected disproportionately by COVID-19. In an attempt to learn if young Black college students unknowingly contribute to the spread of the COVID-19 in their communities, using surveys, this pilot study gauges the general safety knowledge and basic scientific knowledge of Black college students about SARS-COV-2 virus and COVID-19 at an HBCU. We also investigated whether students enrolled in chemistry courses designed for STEM (Science, Technology, and Engineering Majors) majors displayed increased knowledge of SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 in comparison to their non-STEM major peers. Two sets of surveys with multiple choice questions, one with 25 and the other with 34 questions, were designed to assess general safety knowledge and basic scientific knowledge of the students about COVID-19 and the SARS-COV-2 virus. Survey questions were administered through Blackboard learning management system to one hundred eighty-seven (187) students in the summer of 2020 to two freshman non-science majors and in the fall of 2020 to one freshman non-science-major class, two freshmen STEM-major classes, and one senior STEM-major class. All students self-registered in the 6 chemistry classes at North Carolina A&T State University at random with no predetermined criteria. Results of the study show that regardless of their year of study, majority (> 90%) of the students possess basic scientific knowledge and are aware of the safety precautions concerning SARS-COV-2 virus and COVID-19. Majority of non-science major freshmen answered the basic safety questions correctly but were not able to choose the correct answers for the more specific scientific questions concerning SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in basic scientific knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 between STEM and non-STEM student populations, and first year STEM students were just as knowledgeable as senior STEM students. Based on these data, we speculate that students surveyed here have an acceptable basic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, and therefore, they may not be a source of COVID-19 transmission to Black and Brown communities as this study confirms they are receiving accurate information about SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. Possession of crucial timely and accurate knowledge about the health and safety is important in fighting racism and to gain equity within the society at large. By sharing the acquired knowledge, students can serve as positive role models for others in the community thus encouraging them to pursue science. Education brings equity, sharing the acquired knowledge encourages others to continue their education and succeed in obtaining higher degrees and better jobs as remedies for social inequality. Spread of accurate knowledge on various aspects of COVID-19 will also help remove fears of vaccination and hesitation towards visits to health clinics to resolve health issues. Relying on the results of this pilot study, we plan to explore these important factors further in our next study.

AB The animated children's television show, Doc McStuffins, may serve as an out-of-school multicultural STEM education platform for its young television audience. The lead character, as well as the supporting cast of toy characters, represents a variety of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities while modeling medicine and healthcare practices. A critical race sociological perspective recognizes that, in the U.S., racism and social stratification are endemic and this practice of culturally characterizing the toys is situated within a larger historical and sociopolitical context where different cultures, identities, and communities experience differences in power, privilege, and oppression. At times, toys were representative of communities that have historically endured oppression, e.g. communities of color, immigrant communities, and communities with low-income status. Furthermore, in the show, the doctor diagnoses and responds to medical challenges faced by the toy characters and these medical challenges were, at times, caused or exacerbated by the behavior or disposition of some of the toys themselves. Thus, toys were also variably characterized as exhibiting problematic healthcare behavior, while some toys exhibited positive healthcare behavior. Healthcare behavior was similarly located within an ideological context which has associated communities of color, especially those with low-income status, with irresponsible, self-destructive behavior and dependency, as well as an overburdened welfare state. Of concern was the intersection, especially disproportionately, of problematic healthcare behavior and toys representative of communities that have endured these and other related negative characterizations. Through counter-storytelling, the dominant narrative of the television show foregrounded in diversity is complicated to trace adaptive and resilient racial ideologies into new settings and structures. The ideological underpinnings and limitations of diversity itself in our current sociopolitical context are utilized to further examine the phenomenon within the television show.

AB Racial discrimination remains a mechanism by which ethnic-racial minorities are restricted from power. We examined whether racial discrimination restricts ethnic-racial minority access to high-achieving STEM schools. We conducted an audit correspondence experiment to investigate racial discrimination in guidance counselor responsiveness to 976 emails from fictitious Asian, Black, Latina, and White mothers inquiring about school enrollment. Moderation analyses revealed that guidance counselors restricted access from Asian mothers at schools characterized as rural, lower socioeconomic status, and higher STEM prestige-evidence of gatekeeping points to the restriction of Asian students from advanced STEM opportunities. Results are situated within educational audit experiments to objectively document how racism from multiple facets of the education system intersect to inhibit ethnic-racial minority youth.

AB Public Significance Statement Gender and ethnicity play a critical role in retention efforts to increase the number of women in STEM fields, as these factors seems to influence the extent to which interventions can enhance Hispanic/Latina women's self-identification as a woman in STEM. Results suggest that when women's ethnicity matched that of a fictious role model scientist, participants were faster to associate the self with science-based words, indicating greater implicit identification with STEM. Findings support the call for tailored intervention materials when attempting to retain women of color in fields that are largely White and male-dominated.
   Women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related careers are an underrepresented population due to the stigma and sexism they often face. Hispanic and Latina women are further underrepresented in STEM and experience "double jeopardy" due to sexism and racism. Due to factors such as these, women, and especially women of color, are often pushed out of their academic and career paths in STEM fields, further exacerbating what has been termed the "leaky pipeline" phenomenon. The present study seeks to create and evaluate a comic book-style intervention intended to promote the retention of women, and in particular Hispanic/Latina women, in STEM fields. Following exposure to a comic book that depicted a female scientist-vigilante who was either non-Hispanic/Latina White or a Hispanic/Latina, we assessed female STEM majors' implicit identification and self-reported group identification with STEM-based fields. Analyses revealed a significant two-way interaction such that when participants' ethnicity matched that of the vigilante's, implicit identification as a woman in STEM was stronger compared to instances in which a mismatch occurred. Hispanic/Latina participants who read about a Hispanic/Latina vigilante associated science and self words faster relative to Hispanic/Latina participants who read about a non-Hispanic/Latina White vigilante. Results did not support the matching hypothesis for explicit group identification. Ethnicity of female role models is an influential factor to consider when developing interventions to recruit and retain women in STEM, as well as the extent to which these materials increase women's identification with STEM-based fields. Recommendations for future research of similar intervention approaches are discussed.

AB A recent push toward addressing antiracism in science reveals a need to integrate discussions of racism, social justice, and equity into undergraduate STEM classes. Toward this end, in Fall 2020, a theme of "Racism is a Public Health Emergency" was incorporated as an overlay for an existing undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. This theme was used throughout the entire semester and involved discussions of racism, social justice, and equity that were directly integrated with the science content of the course. Students enrolled in the class were surveyed at the end of the semester regarding their perceptions of integrating discussions of racism, social justice, and/or equity into chemistry courses. Students indicated that the inclusion of the overlay increased the relevance of the course material, indicated a high level of understanding of the impact of bias and race on the field of biochemistry, and expressed overwhelmingly positive views regarding future inclusion of similar themes of equity and antiracism in chemistry courses. Additionally, student scores and answers on common final exam questions were compared to previous semesters, revealing that the inclusion of this overlay did not negatively impact coverage of biochemistry content.

AB Despite significant investment in expanding post-secondary access and success for racially minoritized populations within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, persistent educational disparities remain. While the literature has importantly identified and described the myriad ways in which students of color experience exclusion within STEM fields on the basis of race (and, perhaps, other social identity statuses), this area of scholarship is not always theoretically grounded in an understanding of racial hierarchies, processes of racialization, or theories of race and racism. That is, despite the abundant literature on students of color in STEM, there is comparatively limited theoretical attention to race itself, which limits conceptual understanding of the complexities associated with navigating and negotiating STEM contexts. For example, an emphasis on the presumed detrimental or beneficial experiences and outcomes associated with racial minority status may oversimplify the complexity of how race and racism are subjectively experienced at the individual level. Specifically, an individual's attempt to understand, navigate, negotiate, or reappraise their racialized status and persist in an inherently stratified, racialized system of educational opportunity is lost when applying essentialist ideas about race, thus reinforcing dichotomous ideas about advantageous or detrimental consequences of racial minority status. To address this, this paper advances a new conceptual model- the racial reappraisal framework-that more fully accounts for the complex cognitive work students of color engage in when they consider and experience racialization and racism.

AB Pre-university bridging programs can address the significant under-representation of Indigenous students in Australian universities by providing culturally supported alternative pathways into undergraduate study. However, successful completion of bridging programs does not always correlate with university enrolment for Indigenous students. This paper offers a pedagogical rationale for an Indigenous bridging program that aims to address this discrepancy. The program curriculum challenges deficit myths about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and education, while developing foundational academic skills for university study. Leveraging transformative learning and cultural interface theories, the program aims to empower students with the opportunity to develop their own narratives about Indigeneity and university, free from deficit stereotypes. Since implementation of this myth-busting pedagogy, Indigenous student records indicate marked improvement in bridging program pass rates and in transitions into undergraduate study. Additionally, enrolments into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) tripled. Students' weekly reflections, collected over seven iterations of the course, suggest that the transformative pedagogy developed students' self-awareness, self-efficacy, self-confidence and sense of belonging at university.

AB Although the community college plays an essential role in educating minoritized students in STEM related fields, it is also a site where the compounding effects of systemic racism in the nation's educational system are abundantly clear. Due in large part to inequitable access to college-preparatory curriculum in secondary schooling, racially minoritized community college students are more likely than their White peers to be placed in developmental (remedial) math coursework, and less likely to complete the developmental requirements. Over the past decade, heightened concern with high rates of non-completion in developmental math has led community colleges to engage in an unprecedented level of reform, restructuring their programs in order to facilitate students' progression into college level math and science courses. However, whether such reforms have improved minoritized students' opportunities to learn remains unclear. In this study, we applied a race-conscious analytical framework in order to explore the messages embedded in curricular artifacts from developmental math courses at a college pursuing reform. Using indicators of equity-mindedness, we examined the extent to which the curricular artifacts embody explicit messages about diversity and cultural inclusiveness, reflect aspects of culturally responsive teaching, or challenge assumptions embedded in the dominant approach to mathematics education (i.e., racial apathy and color blindness). In addition to documenting a lack of equity-mindedness and cultural inclusivity in our sample of cultural artifacts, our analysis offers a set of tools for researching and assessing ongoing developmental math reforms across community colleges.

AB It is well established that there is a national problem surrounding the equitable participation in and completion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) higher education programs. Persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) experience lower course performance, major retention, sense of belonging, and degree completion. It is unclear though how pervasive these issues are across an institution, from the individual instructor, course, and discipline perspectives. Examining over six years of institutional data from a large-enrollment, research-intensive, minority-serving university, we present an analysis of racial opportunity gaps between PEERs and non-PEERs to identify the consistency of these issues. From this analysis, we find that there is considerable variability as to whether a given course section taught by a single instructor does or does not exhibit opportunity gaps, although encouragingly we did identify exemplar instructors, course-instructor pairs, courses, and departments that consistently had no significant gaps observed. We also identified significant variation across course-instructor pairs within a department, and found that certain STEM disciplines were much more likely to have courses that exhibited opportunity gaps relative to others. Across nearly all disciplines though, it is clear that these gaps are more pervasive in the lower division curriculum. This work highlights a means to identify the extent of inequity in STEM success across a university by leveraging institutional data. These findings also lay the groundwork for future studies that will enable the intentional design of STEM education reform by leveraging beneficial practices used by instructors and departments assigning equitable grades.

ID DISCRIMINATION
AB In recent years, sport reflects the most painful trends in social development, economics, culture, and international politics.
   Major international sporting events of the summer 2021 reveal, according to authors, the crisis of Olympism and degradation of the ideological and philosophical basis of professional sport, which is an important element of international relations undergoing a noticeable transformation under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic and the exacerbation of racist traumas of the past.
   The study is based on social constructivism, it uses elements of critical discourse analysis and comparative analysis. European Football Championship and Olympic Games in Tokyo 2021, FIFA 2022 qualifiers show some politically motivated refereeing, as well as bursts of racism on the part of individual participants. The principle of "political correctness" widespread in the West makes it difficult to discuss and deal with historical and colonial traumas, as well as with the crisis in the values of "fair play" in professional sports, caused by its commercialization and politicization.
   The article concludes that the observed facts stem, among other things, from the revival of the Black Lives Matter movement in the spring of 2020, which spread beyond the borders of the United States, the formation and expansion of the"cancel culture; as well as the growing influence of social networks and media on world public opinion.The coronavirus pandemic, announced in the spring of 2020, has exacerbated old national problems, and brought to the fore new phenomena in world sports.

AB Higher education research has documented that racism and cisheteropatriarchy overlap to shape barriers and support opportunities for undergraduate queer and trans* students of color (QTSOC). However, research specific to STEM pedagogical practices (e.g., curricular design, classroom instruction, student support) is missing from this literature, which can provide discipline-specific insights on affirming classroom practices for this population. Reform in undergraduate STEM curriculum and instruction has largely focused on supporting all students, which upholds the guise of neutrality while leaving unchallenged the interlocking functions of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy. As a response to the JWM themed issue's call for reimagining STEM higher education research, this position paper proposes a queer of color research agenda to generate alternative approaches for undergraduate pedagogy that disrupt the violence of neutrality in STEM. Our agenda makes a twofold contribution. First, we extend research on racism and misogyny in undergraduate STEM classrooms by exploring how cisheteropatriarchy informs variation in racially minoritized students'experiences of pedagogical practices when considering minoritized gender and sexual identities. Second, the agenda brings a focus on STEM pedagogy to research on QTSOC, which has been overlooked despite its impact on students' academic persistence and disciplinary identity constructions. The position paper concludes with implications for departmental faculty, college/university leaders, and federal agencies to assist the development of educational practice and policies that disrupt STEM neutrality responsible for marginalization among undergraduate QTSOC.

   PERCEPTIONS; DIVERSITY; PROGRESS
AB Rampant gender-based harassment and discrimination are recognized problems that negatively impact efforts to diversify science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We explored the particularities of this phenomenon in the geosciences, via focus groups conducted at STEM professional society meetings, with the goal of informing interventions specific to the discipline. Using grounded theory analysis, two primary drivers for the persistence and perpetuation of gender-based harassment in the geosciences were identified: a particular history of power dynamics and maintenance of dominant stereotypes, and a pattern of ineffective responses to incidents of harassment and discrimination. Informed by intersectional feminist scholarship by women of color that illustrates how efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in STEM without attending to the overlapping impacts of racism, colonialism, ableism, and classism will not succeed, we view harassment and discrimination as structural problems that require collective solutions. Continuing to recruit individuals into a discipline without changing its fundamental nature can tokenize and isolate them or encourage assimilation and acceptance of deep-seated traditions no matter how damaging. It is the responsibility of those in power, and especially those who hold more privileged status due to their social identities, to contribute to the dismantling of current structures that reinforce inequity. By providing explanatory illustrative examples drawn from first-person accounts we aim to humanize the numbers reported in workplace climate surveys, address gaps in knowledge specific to the geosciences, and identify interventions aligned with an intersectional framework that aim to disrupt discriminatory practices endemic to the geosciences and larger STEM community.

AB This study examines the relationship between effective pedagogical practices and college GPAs of underrepresented minority (URM) STEM majors at ten research universities. Analyzing data from 2027 URM STEM collegians who completed the Student Experience in the Research University survey, this study intentionally employed disaggregated data to explore the unique influences of pedagogical practices as they relate to students' GPAs. The results identified several significant relationships between good practices and students' likelihood to have at least a 3.0 GPA. Several items had positive associations with students' GPA, while out-of-class group projects had a negative relationship. This study concludes with implications for practice and research.

TI NOT IN ANYONE'S BACKYARD: EXPLORING ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY UNDER

   CANADA</i>
SO APPEAL
LA English
DT Article

AB Pollution hotspots exist across Canada and disproportionately affect low-income and racialized populations. Examples include Indigenous communities like Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Ontario or Beaver Lake Cree Nation in Alberta; predominantly Black communities in rural Nova Scotia; and poor neighbourhoods in urban cities like Toronto or Vancouver. Such communities face disproportionate environmental burdens due to their proximity to landfills, fossil fuel infrastructure, plastic pollution, and toxic waste. This proximity causes harrowing health effects that would otherwise not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada. Although these inequalities stem from a number of interrelated factors, the role of the state in regulating (and facilitating) polluting activity is key. Across jurisdictions, ministries grant pollution permits to new and existing facilities based on deficient regulatory standards laid out under environmental protection legislation. Ministry officials have direct control over when and where pollution occurs. This paper contends that the inequality that results from these regulatory frameworks triggers constitutional scrutiny under section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is an example of adverse effects discrimination from a legislative framework that appears neutral on its face. Although the application of section 15 to environmental inequality is underexplored, recent developments in the jurisprudence suggest that remedying adverse (environmental) effects discrimination may be more viable than ever. This viability stems from the majority decision in Fraser v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28, which introduced significant flexibility into the causation and evidentiary requirements needed to establish adverse effects discrimination under the section. Under the new framework, the popular slogan Not in Anyones Backyard might just be given room to transform from a longstanding aspiration to a new reality.

AB Even in the turn toward justice-oriented pedagogy, computing education tends to overlook the quality of intergroup relationships, which risks entrenching division. In this article, we establish an intercultural approach to computing education, informed by intercultural and peace education, prejudice reduction, and the sociology of racism and ethnicity. We outline three major concerns of intercultural computing: shifting from content toward relationships, from cultural responsiveness to cultural reflexivity, and from identity to identification. For the last, we complicate discourses of race and identity widespread in U.S. education. Drawing from studies of youth programming classes in East Africa and U.S. contexts, we then reflect on our attempts to address the first shift of fostering relationships across difference. We highlight three promising design tactics: intergroup pairing, interdependent programming, and making relational goals explicit. Overall, we find that computing can indeed be a site of intergroup bonding across difference, but that bonding can carry complications and tensions with other equity goals and tactics. Rather than framing justice-oriented CS primarily as changes to the aims of computational learning, we argue that future work should explore making relational goals explicit and teach students how to attend to friction.

AB Global protests and civil unrest in 2020 has renewed the world's interest in addressing injustice due to structural racism and oppression toward Black and Latinx people in all aspects of society, including computing. In this article, we argue that to address and repair the harm created by institutions, policies, and practices that have systematically excluded Black and Latina girls from computer science, an intersectional, transformative justice approach must be taken. Leveraging testimonial authority, we share our past 8 years of experience designing, implementing, and studying Digital Youth Divas, a programmatic and systemic approach to encouraging middle school Black and Latina girls to participate in STEM. Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level.

AB Despite the increasing number of women receiving bachelor's degrees in computing (i.e., Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, etc.), a closer look reveals that the percentage of Black women in computing has significantly dropped in recent years, highlighting the underrepresentation of Black women and its negative impact on broadening participation in the field of computing. The literature reveals that several K-16 interventions have been designed to increase the representation of Black women and girls in computing. Despite these best efforts, the needle seems to have barely moved in increasing the representation or the retention of Black women in computing. Instead, the primary goals have been to recruit and retain women in the CS pipeline using gender-focused efforts intended to increase the number of women who also identify as members of racialized groups. However, these gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge or appreciate how intersectionality (the overlapping social constructs of gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.) has shaped the lived experiences of Black women navigating the computing pipeline. Without honest dialogue about how power operates in the field of computing, the push for racial equality and social justice in CS education remains an elusive goal. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework to address systemic oppression (i.e., racism, gender discrimination, power, and privilege), we interview 24 Black women in different phases of the computing pipeline about their experiences navigating the field of computing. An intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three primary saturated sites of violence within CS education: (1) traditional K-12 classrooms; (2) predominantly White institutions; and (3) internships as supplementary learning experiences. We conclude the article with implications for how the field of CS education can begin to address racial inequality that negatively impacts Black girls and women, thus contributing to a more equitable and socially just field of study that benefits all students.

AB Faculty of color experience a number of challenges within academia, including tokenism, marginalization, racial microaggressions, and a disconnect between their racial/ethnic culture and the culture within academia. The present study examined epistemic exclusion as another challenge in which formal institutional systems of evaluation combine with individual biases toward faculty of color to devalue their scholarship and deem them illegitimate as scholars. Using data from interviews with 118 faculty of color from a single predominantly White, research-intensive institution, we found that epistemic exclusion occurs through formal hierarchies that determine how scholarship is valued and the metrics used to assess quality, and through informal processes that further convey to faculty of color that they and their scholarship are devalued. In addition, there was variability in reporting these experiences by race, gender, nationality, and discipline. We found that faculty of color coped with epistemic exclusion by being assertive and by seeking validation and support outside the institution. Finally, participants described a number of negative work-related and psychological consequences of their epistemic exclusion. We discuss epistemic exclusion as a form of academic gatekeeping that impedes the recruitment, advancement, and retention of faculty of color and offer strategies to address this barrier.

AB The tragic murder of Mr. George Floyd brought to the head long-standing issues of racial justice and equity in the United States and beyond. This prompted many institutions of higher education, including professional organizations and societies, to engage in long-overdue conversations about the role of scientific institutions in perpetuating racism. Similar to many professional societies and organizations, the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading international professional organization for discipline-based biology education researchers, has long struggled with a lack of representation of People of Color (POC) at all levels within the organization. The events surrounding Mr. Floyd's death prompted the members of SABER to engage in conversations to promote self-reflection and discussion on how the society could become more antiracist and inclusive. These, in turn, resulted in several initiatives that led to concrete actions to support POC, increase their representation, and amplify their voices within SABER. These initiatives included: a self-study of SABER to determine challenges and identify ways to address them, a year-long seminar series focused on issues of social justice and inclusion, a special interest group to provide networking opportunities for POC and to center their voices, and an increase in the diversity of keynote speakers and seminar topics at SABER conferences. In this article, we chronicle the journey of SABER in its efforts to become more inclusive and antiracist. We are interested in increasing POC representation within our community and seek to bring our resources and scholarship to reimagine professional societies as catalyst agents towards an equitable antiracist experience. Specifically, we describe the 12 concrete actions that SABER enacted over a period of a year and the results from these actions so far. In addition, we discuss remaining challenges and future steps to continue to build a more welcoming, inclusive, and equitable space for all biology education researchers, especially our POC members. Ultimately, we hope that the steps undertaken by SABER will enable many more professional societies to embark on their reflection journeys to further broaden scientific communities.

TI Discrimination and Psychosocial Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic

DT Article

ID RACISM
AB Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have disproportionately impacted minoritized populations, including rising rates of hate crimes directed at Asian Americans. Asian and White students (N = 1,261) at a large public university completed a survey of their experiences during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures included anxiety, depression, academic engagement, and experienced discrimination. Using structural equation modeling, we found that Asian participants reported experiencing higher discrimination during the first month of the pandemic (e.g., being treated as if you have a disease) compared to White participants. Experienced discrimination was associated with significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety and significantly lower levels of academic engagement. In addition to the physical and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, racism and discrimination may pose unique challenges for Asian Americans in particular.

ID SCIENCE
AB We evaluated the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism on Underrepresented Minority (URM) students pursuing higher education in the STEM fields. Given the ongoing pandemic and the wave of protests in response to a series of police brutalities and systemic racism, URM students were thrown into uncharted territory. We reached out to a group of Black and Latino students who were already engaged in STEM. We began surveys and interviews by asking participants how they were and how their family and communities were doing. Next, participants answered questions about academic progress, challenges, and what support would be helpful. Our framework was based on a mixed-methods approach that draws on the work of Michael Patton (Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice, 2014) and Veronica Thomas (American Journal of Evaluation, 2016, 38 (1), 7-28). Qualitative data from interviews were collected to capture perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of the study participants. Survey data were collected to reach as many students as possible and to provide numerical self-assessments of student experience, progression, and obstacles. All qualitative data were coded thematically using Atlas. ti, with the goal of illuminating emerging themes, and quantitative data were reviewed using descriptive statistics. Themes emerging from both data sets were compared, contrasted, and integrated in order to develop consistent findings that would enhance URM student perseverance and persistence in the face of confounding adversities. This study shows that ILSAMP COVID-19 Study participants maintained a commitment to pursuing a career in STEM. The findings of this study also indicate that the participants are stressed by their immediate circumstances and by the ongoing racism of U.S. society. These students ask for additional financial, academic, and networking support during the disruptions caused by the pandemic. More specifically, students request continued advising and connection with STEM professionals who can help them envision and enact a pathway to their own careers in STEM during this tumultuous period. The study validates the importance of key elements of the national LSAMP model as reported by Clewell et al. (Revitalizing the Nation's Talent Pool in STEM, 2006). These are: academic integration, social integration, and professional integration. In addition, it identifies several other factors that are key to student success, including interventions that directly address racial trauma and economic hardship.

DE Diversity; Equity; Civil engineering education; Thematic analysis;
   Inclusive professional identities
ID EDUCATION; SCIENCE; GENDER; ATTITUDES; GAY
AB Despite growing efforts, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have yet to address long-standing engineering participation disparities. Often, diversity and inclusion issues, along with other societal challenges, are perceived as unrelated to engineering. Conversely, engineering as currently practiced and taught is embedded in dominant culture norms that are frequently invisible to the majority of the students and faculty. One strategy to shift this erroneous "neutral" perspective is to integrate diversity and inclusion into engineering curricula. Using inclusive professional identities as a theoretical lens, we developed an activity that incorporates diversity and inclusion into the technical content of Engineering Mechanics: Statics. Using thematic analysis, we found that students' responses to prompts about their identities, engineering as a profession, and their perceived learning revealed two primary themes: teamwork and engineering/math-related skills/experiences. Although diversity and inclusion were included in responses, students did not connect diversity and inclusion to engineering as a profession. Therefore, students might need more support to make this connection. Although singular activities cannot explicitly overcome racism, sexism, or other deeply entrenched biases in our society, the activity type we describe might help students develop a more holistic perspective of engineering and understand the importance of addressing biases in their future engineering careers.

AB The dominant theoretical approach to exploring ethnic and racial inequality in marketing and consumer research focuses on discrete acts of discrimination that stem from social psychological causes (e.g., prejudice, stereotypes, and negative racial attitudes). It holds limited explanatory power for meso- and macro-structural phenomena that also generate racialized outcomes. An implication is that ethnic and racial inequality can be portrayed as something imposed on market systems rather than a routine feature of their functioning. In response, I introduce and synthesize two variants of Racial Formation Theory (RFT) and propose it as a useful theoretical approach for addressing whether and how organizational and institutional actors in market systems engage in goal-directed action that allocates resources in ways that challenge (or reinforce) ethnic and racial oppression.

AB COVID-19 has already swept millions of lives and created the deep black cloud made up of negative emotions. Analysis of origin of negative emotions from previous experiences indicates diversity in thinking, reasoning, self-centeredness and lack of empathy give rise to human vices which are difficult but not impossible to overcome by resurrection of positive emotions like love, empathy, motivation for good deeds and philanthropic activities. Complex interplay of positive and negative emotions orchestrated by intricately associated neuronal circuits, neurotransmitters coupled with endocrinal influence holds responsible for human behavior, considered as the root of human civilization, is currently facing existential crisis during COVID-19 pandemic. Human civilization is experiencing unique psychosocial problems through emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, panic buying, herd behavior, infodemic, immense sufferings of marginalized people, surge of addictive behavior, racism, domestic violence, rape, divorce, financial constraints, stigmatization, all stem from negative emotions and lack of positive vibes amidst the rally of death and sorrows. COVID-19 and surge of negative emotions are the two pandemics which conjointly causing major mental health threat. Cultivations and practice of positive emotions and triumph of optimistic octet over sinister septet are desirable to save Mother Nature and her habitats from the cruel claws of this pandemic.

TI Trends in the Representation of Women Among US Geoscience Faculty From

AB Inequalities persist in the geosciences. White women and people of color remain under-represented at all levels of academic faculty, including positions of power such as departmental and institutional leadership. While the proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been cataloged previously, new programs and initiatives aimed at improving diversity, focused on institutional factors that affect equity in the geosciences, necessitate an updated study and a new metric for quantifying the biases that result in under-representation. We compile a data set of 2,531 tenured and tenure-track geoscience faculty from 62 universities in the United States to evaluate the proportion of women by rank and discipline. We find that 27% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46% of assistant professors, 34% of associate professors, and 19% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the "leaky pipeline." Efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor. Our results suggest a need for 1:1 hiring between men and women to reach gender parity. Due to significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences.

TI Putting them on a strong spiritual path: Indigenous doulas responding to
   the needs of Indigenous mothers and communities

AB Objective In the past few years, increasing numbers of Indigenous doula collectives have been forming across Canada. Indigenous doulas provide continuous, culturally appropriate support to Indigenous women during pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. This support is critical to counter systemic medical racism and socioeconomic barriers that Indigenous families disproportionately face. This paper analyzes interviews with members of five Indigenous doula collectives to demonstrate their shared challenges, strategies, and missions. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with members of five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada in 2020. Interviews were transcribed and returned to participants for their approval. Approved transcripts were then coded by all members of the research team to ascertain the dominant themes emerging across the interviews. Results Two prominent themes emerged in the interviews. The first theme is "Indigenous doulas responding to community needs." Participants indicated that responding to community needs involves harm reduction and trauma-informed care, supporting cultural aspects of birthing and family, and helping clients navigate socioeconomic barriers. The second theme is "Indigenous doulas building connections with mothers." Participants' comments on providing care to mothers emphasize the importance of advocacy in healthcare systems, boosting their clients' confidence and skills, and being the "right" doula for their clients. These two inter-related themes stem from Indigenous doulas' efforts to counter dynamics in healthcare and social services that can be harmful to Indigenous families, while also integrating cultural teachings and practices. Conclusion This paper illustrates that Indigenous doula care responds to a wide range of issues that affect Indigenous women's experiences of pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. Through building strong, trusting, and non-judgemental connections with mothers and responding to community needs, Indigenous doulas play a critical role in countering medical racism in hospital settings and advancing the resurgence of Indigenous birthing sovereignty.

AB In the United States, the nation's health is not an organic outcome. It is not a coincidence that certain groups of people living in the United States experience higher premature death rates or poorer health outcomes than others. For centuries, racial and ethnic as well as geographic differences in health outcomes have been part of the American landscape, so entrenched in society that many people fail to recognize that health inequities were intentionally derived. A national crisis tends to magnify inequities in our society, but even more alarming is the fact that as the country becomes more racially and ethnically diverse in the coming years, the health inequities are projected to worsen if we do not proactively and immediately address them. As we continue to grapple with the lasting impact of the pandemic, it is of vital importance that we utilize this time to acknowledge, understand, and seriously address the health inequities that have historically plagued the country for over 400 years. As the United States works overtime to stem the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, it must also work equally hard to move in a more equitable, inclusive, and healthier direction, not only because of the more than 83 000 Americans dying prematurely each year but also because of the economic and national security toll it will have if not effectively addressed.

AB While research has documented the tremendous success of graduate-level Bridge programs for boosting the numbers of minoritized students earning doctorates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, less is understood about the challenges participants face along their graduate journey while participating in Bridge programs. Anzalduan concepts including nepantla frame minoritized STEM Bridge students' experiences. This study included interviews with 29 student participants (the majority of whom were African American or Latina/o/x(1)) and 19 faculty mentors or staff program coordinators drawn from five Bridge-to-the-Doctorate STEM programs. Participants described two key challenges: (a) othering by non-bridge peers and (b) intense scrutiny by faculty and staff. Findings show that the presence of Bridge programs alone does not disrupt traditional norms and practices in STEM fields. Implications are discussed for intentionally constructing graduate Bridge programs and supporting departments as they strive to improve inclusion and equity within graduate STEM education.

AB The perceptions of students interested in STEM, particularly those too often excluded due to race and/or gender, are necessary to create educational experiences that additively contribute to students' access and inclusion in STEM. The purpose of this inquiry was to understand the perceptions of 34 high-school students about race and gender representation in STEM. Students participated in a 3-week, university-sponsored summer programme geared toward teaching and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). At the end of the programme, we interviewed students about STEM in their community, STEM role models, potentially working in a STEM field, barriers to STEM, and why they think White men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields. Guided by a critical framework with an intersectional lens, qualitative content analysis of interview data centered on the descriptive codes "race" and "gender" using a constant comparative analytic approach. Results indicated that participants (1) drew on family role models in STEM, (2) used White privilege and patriarchy at varying levels to explain exclusion from STEM, (3) described limited, stereotypical, and hidden depictions of race and gender in STEM, and (4) often perceived STEM as "pushed" while not explicitly associating STEM with helping, or giving back to their community. Implications drawn from participant perspectives call for educational endeavors that expand dominant conceptions of who and what is considered STEM, center students' families and communities, utilize a problem-based approach positioning STEM as a tool for social justice, and include direct conversations about gendered racism and stereotypes.

AB If we envision a future for Black young learners where their full humanity is honoured and educators facilitate rigorous science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning experiences that are justice-focused, we must disrupt systemic racism now. In this article we discuss how anti-Blackness is pervasive in science and mathematics education, especially for young learners. We also address why teacher educators must disrupt anti-Black racism in our work with elementary teacher candidates and in our research. We argue that to do this work and disrupt anti-Blackness, elementary teacher educators and teacher candidates need political clarity (Beauboeuf-LaFontant, 1999). Political clarity is the understanding of how structural and school inequalities work to (re)produce differential learning experiences for minoritized learners. We offer suggestions for how teacher educators can further develop their teacher candidates' political clarity. Drawing upon our prior research, course assignments, and experiences as Black women educators and teacher educators, we share examples of how an individual's political clarity can be developed within science and mathematics methods courses. In doing so, we build upon prior research in STEM teacher education on how teachers come to see teaching as a political act and engage in the hard work of equity-focused STEM teaching.

AB Mentoring is an important aspect of workplace advancement, particularly for faculty of color (FOC). Due to low representation of FOC at higher ranks in many fields, FOC are often mentored by someone of a different race, typically someone who is white. Faculty mentors who differ from their mentee on race may be less equipped to support FOC in navigating the unique challenges they face within the academy (e.g., racism, tokenism, microaggressions), but may also use their racial privilege to support mentees. The current qualitative study examines FOC perceptions about how race affects their cross-racial mentoring relationships. We analyzed interview data of 56 tenure-track faculty from a large, predominantly white, Midwestern research university. Our analysis yielded three themes: (a) factors that shape how race affects the mentoring relationship, (b) racial difference as conferring benefits to the mentoring relationship, and (c) racial difference as irrelevant to the mentoring relationship. In our discussion, we highlight the ways cross-racial mentors can offer support to FOC, while also taking into account the limitations associated with these mentoring relationships. We conclude with recommendations for how institutions may enhance the mentoring of FOC.

AB President Trump's education policies continue to marginalize Black STEM students at the highest levels of education. Responding to a survey on their racialized educational experiences and future career trajectories, an ethnically diverse group of Black STEM doctoral students expressed anxiety about trying to pursue a STEM career during the Trump presidency. Their responses reflected their heightened sense of urgency to be change agents for racial justice in both the STEM arena and the wider society. These survey findings demonstrate that the Trump administration has created anxiety among minoritized people about pursuing STEM careers and triggered an activist spirit in this group of future STEM PhDs. In this paper, I discuss the ways the racist ideologies, practices, and policies of the Trump administration are impairing scientific innovation and increasing activism among Black STEMers. The findings reveal a vital need to continue discussing the consequences of the Trump administration's assault on Blacks in the STEM disciplines.

AB There is a severe shortage of Black scientists in the United States. Amid the recent national movement to dismantle systemic racism and racial injustices, many scientists publicly highlighted the prevalence of racist learning environments in STEM, contributing to the underrepresentation of Black students in STEM fields. Acknowledging this longstanding troubling reality, this article emphasizes the instrumental role of chemistry department chairs in advancing Black student success in chemistry and STEM broadly. Guided by literature on systemic change and equity in higher education as well as our research on the Black student experience and teaching practices in chemistry, this article describes the following five recommendations for actions that chemistry chairs should consider enacting to promote equitymindedness within their departments to advance Black student success: (i) disaggregate data to make publicly visible racial inequities; (ii) offer formal opportunities for Black students to candidly share their perspectives; (iii) conduct systematic assessment of course syllabus; (iv) measure teaching practices; and (v) create chemistry education research positions. The enactment of these recommendations by chemistry chairs provides meaningful opportunities for faculty and staff to critically examine the chemistry learning environment using an equity-minded approach to in turn inform the development of strategic efforts to support the advancement of Black student success.

ID LIFE
AB Although it is argued that social justice is a core concern for the discipline, nursing has not generally played a leadership role in the responses to many of the greatest social problems of our time. These include the accelerated rate of climate change, pandemic threats, systemic racism, growing health and social inequities, and the regulation of new technologies to ensure an equitable future 'for all.' In nursing codes of ethics, administration, education, policies, and practice, social justice is often claimed to be a core value, yet it is rarely contextualized by philosophical or theoretical underpinnings. It appears that nurses' commitment to social justice may stem more from a penchant for 'doing good' than an attempt to explore, understand, and enact what is meant by social justice from an ontological, epistemological, and methodological perspective. We contend that the dominance of a human science perspective in nursing contributes to a narrow definition of health and relegates many issues central to social justice to the margins of nurses' care. In this article, we explore how the focus on 'the human' in the human science perspective may not only be limiting the capacity of nurses to develop strategies to adequately address social injustice, but in some instances, direct nurses to contribute to their very reproduction. We suggest that a critical interrogation of this human-centric hegemony can identify avenues of rupture and introduce posthumanism as an additional philosophical perspective for consideration to help bridge the human-social divide.

AB Established in 2019, the Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in STEM convenes a broad array of stakeholders that focus on the barriers and opportunities encountered by Black men and Black women as they navigate the pathways from K-12 and postsecondary education to careers in science, engineering, and medicine. Through meetings, public workshops, and publications, the Roundtable advances discussions that raise awareness and/or highlight promising practices for increasing the representation, retention, and inclusiveness of Black men and Black women in STEM. In keeping with the charge of the Roundtable, Roundtable leadership and leaders of the COVID-19 action group conducted an informational video in January 2021 to provide an in-depth discussion around common, justified questions in the Black community pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine. The manuscript addresses selected questions and answers relating to the different types of COVID-19 vaccines and their development, administration, and effectiveness. Discussion focuses on addressing vaccine misconceptions, misinformation, mistrust, and hesitancy; challenges in prioritizing vaccinations in diverse populations and communities; dealing with racism in medicine and public health; optimizing communication and health education; and offering practical strategies and recommendations for improving vaccine acceptance by clinicians, health care workers, and the Black community. This manuscript summarizes the content in the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEC9c48A_k).

AB Due to the dearth of literature that has foregrounded the psychological causes and conditions impacting Black men's academic success while enrolled in STEM doctoral programs, this qualitative study examined the psychological costs of racism among 20 Black men enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral programs. Utilizing Critical Race Theory to contextualize and situate this study, this manuscript explored racialized interactions between Black men and their non-Black advisors and colleagues using semi-structured qualitative interviews. The multiple forms of racism that Black men encounter consists of (1) Black male exceptionalism (e.g., the Barack Obama Effect), (2) the expectation that they will be the spokesperson for the entire Black race, (3) the White oppositional gaze directed towards their physical appearance and stature, and (4) that their departments turn a blind eye towards issues of racism. Black men navigate, negotiate, and respond to racism in their departments by resigning from their diversity-focused leadership positions due to their racialized 'token' status, tapping into their spirituality, and by acquiring an arrogant yet humble demeanor to combat racial hostilities. The recommendations of this study provide strategies and tools for ensuring that college and university administrators and faculty provide safe spaces for Black men to thrive and succeed in academia.

AB This paper utilizes poststructural theory to analyze student artifacts that were collected from a history of mathematics course. The course was designed to counter three types of mathematical narratives, relating to: 1) race, 2) intelligence, and 3) innateness. To address these narratives, the course highlighted the contributions of communities of color and other minoritized populations in the historical development of mathematics. It also explicitly challenged dominant constructions of mathematical history and problematized their use to further the power and privilege of particular groups. Analyses of student artifacts showed that this course provided space for students to defy innate intelligence racial narratives and strengthen their own counter-stories.

AB Success and impact metrics in science are based on a system that perpetuates sexist and racist "rewards" by prioritizing citations and impact factors. These metrics are flawed and biased against already marginalized groups and fail to accurately capture the breadth of individuals' meaningful scientific impacts. We advocate shifting this outdated value system to advance science through principles of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. We outline pathways for a paradigm shift in scientific values based on multidimensional mentorship and promoting mentee well-being. These actions will require collective efforts supported by academic leaders and administrators to drive essential systemic change.

AB Building on previous research that has described the underrepresentation of women of color in science fields, this paper presents case studies of Black middle school girls to examine how their science identities developed over space and time. Data were collected over the course of their seventh-grade year in both in school (science classroom) and out-of-school (afterschool club) contexts. The Multidimensionality of Black Girls' STEM Learning framework was used to explore the role of the afterschool club as a counterspace and how students made sense of science, science people, and their current and future selves based on their experiences in school and after school science contexts. All three participants struggled to see their future selves as scientists and made distinctions amongst being a science person, a person who likes science, or a scientist. They also negotiated views of science as active and hands-on in the afterschool setting while experiencing more passive and decontextualized forms of science in the formal school setting. Implications include a need to disrupt the culture of science and reimagine formal science education by learning from out-of-school time science programs that function as counterspaces to support Black girls' science identity. We conclude that there remains a need to draw attention to and understand the role of race and racism in science education so that Black girls' science identities are affirmed beyond counterspaces.

AB For most of the scientific disciplines associated with coastal and estuarine research, workforce representation does not match the demographics of communities we serve, especially for Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Indigenous peoples. This essay provides an overview of this inequity and identifies how a scientific society can catalyze representational, structural, and interactional diversity to achieve greater inclusion. Needed changes go beyond representational diversity and require an intentional commitment to build capacity through inclusivity and community engagement by supporting anti-racist policies and actions. We want to realize a sense of belonging on the part of scientists in society at large and enable research pursuits through a lens of social justice in service of coastal communities. Minimally, this framework offers an avenue for increased recruitment of individuals from more diverse racial and ethnic identities. More broadly, the mechanisms described here aim to create a culture in scientific societies in which social justice, driven by anti-racist actions, produces systemic change in how members of scientific societies approach, discuss, and address issues of inequity. We have written this essay for members of the coastal and marine science community who are interested in change. We aim to call in new voices, allies, and champions to this work.

AB Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience racialized stress, as structural racism in STEM takes a toll on their sense of belonging and acceptance as intellectually competent in comparison to White and some Asian peers and faculty. Black doctoral students are often told by campus administrators that the source of this racialized stress is impostorism and it is curable. In this article, we employ phenomenological analysis to examine how 54 Black engineering and computing students experience racism marketed as impostor syndrome (syndrome meaning in their heads). Results show that 51 of our study participants understood their experiences as both impostorism and racism, as some realized that racism created the conditions for being racially positioned as an impostor. We problematize impostorism peddled by campus administrators as a cover for racism, once again placing onus on students and claiming they have irrational but curable behaviors, while institutional and individual racism in STEM runs rampant by design.

AB Cancer risk prediction models have the potential to revolutionize the science and practice of cancer prevention and control by identifying the likelihood that a patient will develop cancer at some point in the future, likely experience more benefit than harm from a given intervention, and survive their cancer for a certain number of years. The ability of risk prediction models to produce estimates that are valid and reliable for people from diverse socio-demographic backgrounds-and consequently their utility for broadening the reach of precision medicine to marginalized populations-depends on ensuring that the risk factors included in the model are represented as thoroughly and as accurately as possible. However, cancer risk prediction models created in the United States have a critical limitation, the origins of which stem from the country's earliest days: they either erroneously treat the social construct of race as an immutable biological factor (ie, they "essentialize" race), or they exclude from the model those socio-contextual factors that are associated with both race and health outcomes. Models that essentialize race and/or exclude socio-contextual factors sometimes incorporate "race corrections" that adjust a patient's risk estimate up or down based on their race. This commentary discusses the origins of race corrections, potential flaws with such corrections, and strategies for developing cohorts for developing risk prediction models that do not essentialize race or exclude key socio-contextual factors. Such models will help move the science of cancer prevention and control towards its goal of eliminating cancer disparities and achieving health equity.

AB Public health measures necessary to counteract the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have resulted in dramatic changes in the physical and social environments within which children grow and develop. As our understanding of the pathways for viral exposure and associated health outcomes in children evolves, it is critical to consider how changes in the social, cultural, economic, and physical environments resulting from the pandemic could affect the development of children. This review article considers the environments and settings that create the backdrop for children's health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including current threats to child development that stem from: A) change in exposures to environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, disinfectants, air pollution and the built environment; B) changes in food environments resulting from adverse economic repercussion of the pandemic and limited reach of existing safety nets; C) limited access to children's educational and developmental resources; D) changes in the social environments at the individual and household levels, and their interplay with family stressors and mental health; E) social injustice and racism. The environmental changes due to COVID-19 are overlaid onto existing environmental and social disparities. This results in disproportionate effects among children in low-income settings and among populations experiencing the effects of structural racism. This article draws attention to many environments that should be considered in current and future policy responses to protect children's health amid pandemics.

AB When pupils learn geography they are extending their world view and reshaping it. This paper analyses representations of Africa and African countries and cultures in Irish primary geography textbooks and assesses to what extent these textbook portrayals facilitate or repress multicultural education, specifically critical multicultural education (CMCE). Here, this paper argues that primary geography can and should play a critical role in challenging societal issues of inequality, racism, prejudice and stereotypes, particularly pertaining to perspectives of the 'Other'. This paper devises a framework for critical multicultural geography education (CMCGE) and applies this to Irish primary geography textbooks. While some textbooks can demonstrate capacity in fostering multiple perspectives, appreciation for diversity, development of critical thinking and enquiry, and making connections; in the main, textbooks present stereotypical, oversimplified accounts of issues, peoples and places which can result in feelings of superiority amongst dominant groups and more entrenched feelings of 'Otherness' amongst minority groups.

AB Immigrant Chinese Americans made the recent polling news by being the least racially tolerant in comparison to other Asian American groups over redistributive issues such as college admissions. Rather than treating Chinese immigrants as of monolithic interests and ultimately unassimilable, this study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of the contours and sources of their racial attitudes and beliefs. How do new immigrants from China think of issues of race, race relations, and notions of racial equality and justice in multiracial America? What explains their patterns of racial attitudes and opinions especially the controversial issue of race-based college admissions? These are the main research questions we asked through semistructured interviews conducted in Mandarin of 15 undergraduate students from China studying in STEM, social sciences, and humanities in a public research university on the West Coast. We hypothesize that the formation of racial attitudes of U.S. undergraduate students from China is influenced by their own upbringing in China as well as personal experiences of discrimination, local school context, interracial contacts, media exposure, and classroom learning of U.S. racial history on both sides of the Pacific. These experiences, in turn, help structure their perceptions of the dominant ideology, racial beliefs, and race-based policy preferences in the host society of the United States. Our findings confirm prior research on racial learning but also offer new insights on the contours and sources of racial policy opinion on affirmative action in college admissions.

AB Recent events in America in 2020 have stimulated a worldwide movement to dismantle anti-Black racism in all facets of our lives. Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a "term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically." In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined "Visions" (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals. We would like to specifically acknowledge the Black women who took the time to be interviewed, write perspectives, and share their lived experiences in hopes that it will inspire genuine and lasting change.

AB We frame teachers' contextualization of mathematics (CoM) as a classroom-based identity resource. We explore CoM in secondary classrooms in the segregated school landscape of the US, focusing specifically on schools that serve primarily low-income Black and Latinx students. We review literature that discusses commonly-cited affordances for CoM according to formative, affective, functional literacy, and critical literacy rationales and problematize those rationales relative to prior research. We analyze 58 lessons from 12 classrooms at 11 schools to reveal patterns in CoM relative to those commonly cited affordances. The formative, affective, and functional literacy rationales were frequently evident. Teachers draw largely on generic human experiences and marketplace contexts, positioning students as consumers or employees. There were few instances of CoM naming racism or inequality, and our analysis further reveals blind spots in these efforts. Our discussion considers the implications of these patterns.

AB Efforts to diversify and make historically white organizations more inclusive are as varied as they are numerous. Yet, for all their ubiquity in U.S. higher education, few studies have examined them in real time. This case study thus features a two-day meeting where stakeholders were invited to consider how to make science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields not only more diverse but also inclusive. Drawing on observational, documentary, and interview data, we offer three findings. First, we share how facilitators were ill-prepared to define diversity for their project. Second, we share that facilitators and most white participants hesitated and sometimes directly avoided conversations about historical and contemporary exclusion in STEM, especially regarding racism. Third, we show that, while facilitators and most white participants avoided specific conversations about the exclusionary nature of STEM spaces, racially minoritized participants repeatedly requested more concrete conversations. We conclude the paper with several implications for future research and practice for administrators, professors, DEI practitioners, and funders.

TI Investigating society's educational debts due to racism and sexism in

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH

ID COLORADO LEARNING ATTITUDES; SELF-EFFICACY; WOMEN; GENDER; MODEL;
   IMPUTATION; BELIEFS
AB The American Physical Society calls on its members to improve the diversity of physics by supporting an inclusive culture that encourages women and Black, Indigenous, and people of color to become physicists. In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students' attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based mechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses taught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups representing educational debts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in calculus-based courses, tended to have more expertlike attitudes than any other group of students. Instruction that addresses society's educational debts can help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.

Yet, there are STEM professionals who refrain from public and political discussions simply because they believe that these discussions are irrelevant to their professions. The purpose of this article is to call on those who have remained silent to speak out in support of the Black Lives Matter, specifically those scientific and engineering professionals who practice the "culture of disengagement" from politics and public discourse, for silence equates complicity when it comes to racism.

AB The use of telemedicine in U.S. perinatal care has drastically increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and will likely continue given the national focus on high-value, patient-centered care. If implemented in an equitable manner, telemedicine has the potential to reduce disparities in care access and related outcomes that stem from systemic racism, implicit biases and other forms of discrimination within our health care system. In this commentary, we address implementation factors that should be considered to ensure that disparities are not widened as telemedicine becomes more integrated into care delivery.

AB Recent events prompted scientists in the United States and throughout the world to consider how systematic racism affects the scientific enterprise. This paper provides evidence of inequities related to race-ethnicity and gender in graduate school experiences and career plans of PhD students in the top 100 ranked departments in one science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) discipline, chemistry. Mixed-model regression analyses were used to examine factors that might moderate these differences. The results show that graduate students who identified as a member of a racial/ethnic group traditionally underrepresented in chemistry (underrepresented minorities, URM) were significantly less likely than other students to report that their financial support was sufficient to meet their needs. They were also less likely to report having supportive relationships with peers and postdocs. Women, and especially URM women, were significantly less likely to report supportive relationships with advisors. Despite their more negative experiences in graduate school, students who identified as URM expressed greater commitment to finishing their degree and staying in the field. When there was at least one faculty member within their departments who also identified as URM they were also more likely than other students to aspire to a university professorship with an emphasis on research. Men were significantly more likely than women to express strong commitment to finishing the PhD and remaining in chemistry, but this difference was stronger in top-ranked departments. Men were also more likely than women to aspire to a professorship with an emphasis on research, and this difference remained when individual and departmental-level variables were controlled.

DE Latina; o doctors; deference; demeanor; gender; microaggressions; STEM
AB Prior studies note that gender- and race-based discrimination routinely inhibit women's advancement in medical fields. Yet few studies have examined how gendered displays of deference and demeanor are interpreted by college-educated and professional Latinas/os who are making inroads into prestigious and masculinized nontraditional fields such as medicine. In this article, we elucidate how gender shapes perceptions of authority and competence among the same pan-ethnic group, and we use deference and demeanor as an analytical tool to examine these processes. Our analysis underscores three main points of difference: (1) gendered cultural taxation; (2) microaggressions from women nurses and staff and; (3) the questioning of authority and competence to elucidate how gendered racism manifests for Latina/o doctors. Taking demonstrations of gendered deference and demeanors are vital to transforming medical schools and creating more inclusive spaces for all physicians and patients. Conclusions are based on experiences reported in interviews with 48 Latina/o physicians and observation in their places of work in Southern California.

AB Black women are uniquely located at the intersection of two marginalized identities which puts them at risk of experiencing a combined discrimination known as gendered racism. Among Black Women, experiencing increased gendered racism is associated with higher poorer mental health which includes higher levels of anxiety and depression. To cope with these experiences of gendered racism, Black women often engage in identity shifting by adjusting one's behavior and language to conform to environmental norms. Paradoxically, having a strong sense of one's gendered racial identity has been theorized to potentially protect Black women from the detrimental effects of gendered racism. Two hundred thirty nine young adult U.S. Black women, between the ages of 18 and 35, completed an online survey to examine the role of identity shifting and gendered racial identity centrality on the established link between gendered racism and mental health outcomes, specifically anxiety and depression symptoms. The results indicated that identity shifting did not moderate the associations between gendered racism and anxiety nor depression symptoms. Separate moderation analyses indicated that gendered racial identity centrality moderated the effect of identity shifting on depression but not on anxiety symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of considering identity factors when proposing theories and clinical practices that seek to reduce mental health concerns among young adult U.S. Black women.

AB This paper analyses the social-psychological processes of social comparison and relative deprivation with regard to race, gender, and their intersections in STEM higher education through the narratives of 33 Black respondents who described their experiences within engineering and computer science doctoral programs. I use social comparison and relative deprivation, a subsidiary theory of social comparison, as guiding theoretical frameworks. Since the intersections of race and gender are salient, I also incorporate an intersectional framework as an analytical tool. Through data derived from semi-structured interviews, I find that, when describing graduate-school experiences, Black engineering and computer science respondents use social comparisons with regard to race, gender, and their intersections to juxtapose their experiences with those of their peers. Participants described feeling relatively deprived due to inequities resulting from racism and/or sexism and primarily felt that STEM privileged students that were Asian men. Nevertheless, Black men described downward social comparisons with their Black female counterparts, recognizing the sexist culture of STEM. Overall, however, social comparison processes led Black respondents to identify inequities within their Ph.D. programs in engineering and computer science that made them feel as though STEM was not intended for them, but, rather, for their Asian and white male peers who are positioned as belonging.

AB A growing body of literature has examined the underrepresentation of women of color (WOC) in university engineering programs, but its primary focus has been on the experiences of women students of color. Research on WOC in engineering is usually drawn from all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which does little to illuminate the nuanced experiences of WOC within engineering culture. We sought a primary emphasis on persistence and perseverance rather than the typical examinations on mentoring, inventions, work-life balance, or the challenges that WOC face in engineering faculty environments. There are few studies on how and why women of color persist in academia in the face of the intersection of racism and sexism. Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework and inductive qualitative analyses of interviews with 56 women of color who identified as Asian, Black, Latina, and/or multiracial, we analyzed the sources of support for their persistence. Asking which collective factors support WOC in general and which are unique to each of the racial/ gender groups, we identified three major themes-persistence is aided by (1) supportive colleagues internal to the department or institution, (2) supportive colleagues external to the institution, and (3) the intersectional considerations of group-specific nuances shared by Black, Latina, and Asian women engineering faculty members. The implications suggest women of color thrive in departments with supportive faculty, proactive leadership, and a commitment to professional development. We outline specific racial group interventions that can be beneficial for Asian, Black, and Latina engineering faculty.

AB The lack of minority representation within academic science means that women of color are often isolated from each other. Isolation limits women of color ability to form supportive networks to deal with the stressors that result from bias and discrimination. Isolation can also prevent women of color from creating support networks that may buffer against stressors. We used a grounded approach to explore the extent to which being the "only" woman of color, versus one of a few, mediates the experiences of incivility, harassment, and broader discriminatory practices experienced by science faculty across rank. We ran six focus groups with a total of 15 women of color science faculty at a research-intensive Midwestern university to explore these themes. Our research supports previous findings that women of color of all ranks experience negative workplace experiences such as incivility and harassment, and the exclusion of women of color occurs at both institutional and interpersonal levels. Our findings yielded new insights into how experiences of social isolation lead to the internalization of gaslighting messages that deny or minimize the occurrence of incivility and harassment. We also found that social support helps women to contextualize their experiences, allowing them to recognize and identify it within the broader cultural patterns of sexism and racism. Social exclusion and isolation intensify the negative psychological impact of negative workplace experiences, whereas social support validates women of color negative experiences and helps externalize these events. Therefore, we suggest that the level of isolation experienced by women of color faculty can mediate the relationship between negative experiences in academic science and personal and professional outcomes such as mental health and productivity. We use this model of psychological impacts of incivility and harassment to suggest future areas of research regarding women of color in STEM.

AB In UK higher education, minority ethnic students are less likely to graduate with a good degree than their White British counterparts, even when prior attainment is considered. Until recently, concerns about this ethnicity degree awarding gap have not received the research attention it deserves. In this paper, we contribute to this gap in knowledge with a focus on how students make sense of the difference in degree outcomes by ethnicity. Informed by 69 in-depth interviews with minority and majority ethnic students at a UK university, we explore their views towards the ethnicity degree awarding gap, why it exists and what would be their solution to reduce this difference. Although some students perceived the awarding gap as a reflection of individual aptitude, others have attributed social barriers for degree outcome differences. We present five recommendations as suggested by students for policy and practice. Firstly, the provision of greater economic support for minority ethnic students, which will improve access and a more diverse student population. Secondly, to establish an institutional commitment to challenge and eradicate all forms of racism on campus, including microaggressions. Thirdly, to increase representation of minority ethnic staff and students in higher education to improve students' sense of belongings and aspirations, with the emphasis on greater staff diversity. Fourthly, to diversify the curriculum with a wider range of values and perspectives incorporated into teaching. Finally, universities need to be proactive and reflective to ensure structural barriers are reduced or eliminated through additional support or alternative provisions.

AB Soil science is one of the least diverse fields within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Because demographics of groups and institutions provide a window into the culture, climate, equity and inclusion of minoritized scholars, we discuss how lack of diversity continues to affect our science and the scientific community, and its implications for the welfare of the global population. We highlight the role of antiracist practices and policies for improving workplace climate and thereby developing a diverse and inclusive scientific community. We present this article as a starting point for discussions on issues of race and racism in our scientific community and institutions.
   Highlights
   Soil science remains one of the least diverse fields in STEM.
   Workplace climate plays a major role in perpetuating the lack of diversity within soil science and other fields within geosciences.
   Incorporation of antiracist practices and policies is urgently needed to reverse the current trend and improve representation in our scientific community.

AB This essay uses the novel coronavirus pandemic as an entry point to explore the intersections between race,migration, and global health. The pandemic is simultaneously reviving stereotypical colonial imaginations about disease directionality, but also challenging racialized hierarchies of diseases. This essay illuminates how the racialization of diseases is reflected in historic and ongoing United States' migration law and policy as well as the global health law regime. By demonstrating the close relationship between often separately treated areas, the essay clarifies underlying currents in global health and migration law and policy that stem from fears of the racialized other. Rendering these intersections visible creates avenues for rethinking and reshaping both theory and praxis toward anti-subordination efforts.

AB The evolution education experiences of students of color represent an emerging area of research, because past inquiries indicate these students have differential outcomes, such as lower evolution acceptance and severe underrepresentation in evolutionary biology. Religion is often an important support for students of color who are navigating a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics culture that privileges White nonreligious students. For instance, religion helps mitigate the negative effects of racism, but religious students are also more likely to experience conflict when learning evolution. In this nation-wide study, we examined the extent to which strong religiosity among students of color can explain their lower evolution acceptance. We surveyed students in 77 college biology courses across 17 states and found that Black/African American students tend to be more religious and less accepting of evolution than any other racial/ethnic identity group and that Hispanic students tend to be slightly more religious and slightly less accepting of evolution than White students. Importantly, we find that religious background is an important factor associated with Black and Hispanic students' lower levels of evolution acceptance. This study suggests that the biology community should become more inclusive of Christian religious students if it wishes to foster inclusive evolution education for Black and Hispanic students.

AB Health inequities stem from systematic, pervasive social and structural forces. These forces marginalize populations and create the circumstances that disadvantage these groups, as reflected in differences in outcomes like life expectancy and infant mortality and in inequitable access to and delivery of health care resources. To help eradicate these inequities, physicians must understand racism, sexism, oppression, historical marginalization, power, privilege, and other sociopolitical and economic forces that sustain and create inequities. A new educational paradigm emphasizing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to achieve health equity is needed.
   Systems-based practice is the graduate medical education core competency that focuses on complex systems and physicians' roles within them; it includes topics like multidisciplinary team-based care, patient safety, cost containment, end-of-life goals, and quality improvement. This competency, however, is largely health care centric and does not train physicians to engage with the complexities of the social and structural determinants of health or to partner with systems and communities that are outside health care. The authors propose a new core competency centered on health equity, social responsibility, and structural competency to address this gap in graduate medical education. For the development of this new competency, the authors draw on existing, innovative undergraduate and graduate medical pedagogy and public health, health services research, and social medicine frameworks. They describe how this new competency would inform graduate medical education and clinical care and encourage future physicians to engage in the work of health equity.

AB The racialized structure of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) higher education maintains gross inequities that are illustrative of structural racism, which both informs and is reinforced by discriminatory beliefs, policies, values, and distribution of resources. Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read "assimilate") underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating racially hostile work and educational spaces. I argue that, without a critical examination of the structural racism omnipresent in the STEM, progress in racially diversifying STEM will continue at a snail's pace.

AB The purpose of this qualitative pilot study was to investigate the role of race (and racism) and sense of belonging for Black men in medical school. A single research question guided this exploratory project: How do Black men in medical school describe their experiences? Analyzing interview data from 8 Black male medical school students revealed frequent encounters with racial discrimination and prejudice. Results show that race adversely affected their academic and social experiences and diminished their sense of belonging in medical school. Consequently, they faced difficulty connecting with White peers and faculty, racist stereotypes, and racial microaggressions that stigmatized them as "out of place," unqualified, or unusual. Implications for policy, practice, and minority medical student success are highlighted.

AB At the most basic level of human existence is the need to feel like one belongs. Sense of belonging is correlated with a person's motivation, drive, behavior, and identity. Research suggests institutions of higher education do much to foster students' sense of belonging and create positive learning environments in which faculty use their potential to influence student learning, motivation, and belonging. This paper uses Critical Race Theory (CRT) to examine the problems of student attrition, lack of persistence, and lack of a sense of belonging among marginalized populations undergoing science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) education within U.S. institutions of higher education. Using constructs and tenets of CRT, this paper specifically explores how race and racism in post-secondary STEM education exacerbate the problem while using contextual factors as a guide. Researchers and practitioners alike can use this critical analysis to support current and future work in understanding how educational programs are socially constructed in a way that historically excludes marginalized persons.

AB This paper explores the current views and experiences of university students towards issues of race and racism in England. A decade into the UK's Equality Act (2010), we have witnessed a proliferation of support for minority rights and movements, especially from the younger generation, often praised as progressive and liberal. Yet, in UK higher education, there is growing evidence and concern about racial and ethnic inequalities in the experiences and outcomes of minority ethnic students. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 42 undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees, the authors explore the nuances in racial perspectives as they highlight three contemporary student discourses of racism: the naive; the bystander; and the victim. Implications for policy and practice are suggested.

ID DOUBLE BIND; SCIENCE; WOMEN; RACE
AB Background It is well-documented that experiences in STEM courses for women and students of color are different from the experiences of White men. As part of a larger interview study, 183 college seniors from diverse gender and race backgrounds were asked their thoughts on whether the experience of being a STEM major was different for people of different races and genders. We use a framework of "science as White property", derived from critical race theory, to frame this study and results. Results White men were largely unaware of any impact of race or gender. In contrast, women of color overwhelmingly report, consistent with results from a large body of prior research, that both race and gender impact their experiences as STEM majors. Students who acknowledged race and gender impacts did not always attribute these impacts to cultural or systemic factors (i.e., some reported women are underrepresented because they are less interested in STEM rather than a structural reason). Impacts identified that were attributable to systemic factors included impacts related to being a demographic minority (i.e., intimidation, feeling out of place, feeling pressure to work harder) and/or discrimination (i.e., job discrimination, bias against women or people of color and cultural assumptions implying the superiority of White people and men). A small number of students (mostly White women) stated that women or people of color benefit from their underrepresented status, often attributing this benefit to a perception of extra encouragement and opportunities. A common theme across categorizations was that women and students of color work harder than men and White people either because they are perceived to be harder workers or as a response to the sexism and racism they encounter. Conclusions We found that White men are largely unaware of the impacts of race or gender on the pursuit of a STEM degree. Additionally, with the exception of women of color, students are less likely to perceive race as having an impact on the experiences of students than gender. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future work related to gender and race representation in STEM.

AB This article articulates a robust study of potentially harmful trend toward personalized nutrition through an examination of contemporary conversations and theories surrounding genetic science, race, identity, health, and food. It makes that case that genetic ancestry kits, and the nutritional recommendations that stem from them, represent a misunderstanding of current genetic science and the capabilities of genetic technologies. I argue that the most troubling outcomes these applications are likely to have is in the further reification and perpetuation of racialized and racializing knowledge and discourses. I also make the case that trends in personalized nutrition are likely to produce yet another locus of inequality based on disparities in access to the 'right' foods, the iniquitous distribution of dietary capital, the further responsibilization of health to individuals, increased surveillance, and a more impoverished and functionalized relationship to food itself.

   Curriculum; Health Disparities

AB Background/Purpose: Health disparities disproportionately affect minority populations and are due to multiple factors including discrimination and implicit bias. Biases are ubiquitous throughout society, including the educational and healthcare environment. In health care it is at the patient-provider level that our biases play a major role in patient care exhibiting a rippling effect going beyond individual provider biases affecting not only patients and families but all members of the healthcare team.
   Methods: Although biases are in play across the entire medical school curriculum the most significant impact is during clerkships. During clerkships students are exposed to and prone to adopt and internalize identities and traits that may run counter to the basic tenants of medicine and the Hippocratic tradition of non-maleficence, beneficence, and compassion. Implicit biases develop early, are difficult to change and as shown by recent allegations of political figures appearing in blackface remain intact into adulthood.
   Conclusion/Recommendations: At the institutional level biases can be addressed and mitigated through cultural humility and implicit bias training, training in culturally and linguistically appropriate services, increased workforce diversity through support of STEM- based enrichment programs and curriculum changes that include clinical vignettes emphasizing the effects of race, gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity, on access and quality of care: reflective writing and small group sessions that provide safe spaces for students; and experiential learning in underserved communities. Resulting in an educational environment that directly addresses the role of implicit bias, racism, and discrimination in individual and population health.

AB Background Race and gender disparities remain a challenge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether one's race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by STEM students of color. Results The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other students of color in the sample. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty members, and students to work together to address racism at the campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings reveal the continued presence of anti-Black racism in higher education.

AB Heterogeneity is fundamental to learning and when leveraged in instruction, can benefit racially minoritized children. However, finding ways to leverage heterogeneity toward disciplinary teaching is a formidable challenge and teachers can benefit from targeted support to recognize heterogeneity in STEM, and its relationship to race and racism in disciplinary teaching. These data draw from a nine-day professional development seminar for secondary teachers to promote heterogeneity in STEM learning (n = 12). Drawing on analyses of lesson plans developed by teachers during the seminar, and subsequent video analyses of small group discussions, we present a case of four teachers debating heterogeneity in science. The exchange is significant because it draws into relief the ideological and emotional terrain of disturbing the racial hierarchy in which Western Modern Science (WMS) is steeped, and its implications for the education of racially minoritized youth. In the focus interaction, a dynamic emerged where three teachers exalted WMS, while the fourth grappled with how cultural heterogeneity has or could matter to her science teaching. Drawing on the constructs of racial-ideological micro-contestation and racial microaggressions, this analysis illustrates three important dimensions to the design of professional learning for STEM teachers that center race: (1) how discipline-specific discussions can uniquely surface the latent racial and ideological meanings teachers associate with STEM; (2) the centrality of teachers' storied knowledge in grappling with heterogeneity; and (3) the interplay of micro-contestation and microaggressions in understanding and anticipating the experiences of minoritized teachers when debating issues of race, disciplinarity, and teaching.

AB Using critical race structuralism (CRS), a new contribution, as well as primary and secondary data, this article explores the role of science in teaching social justice issues in urban education. In the United States, a teaching workforce, which is predominately White, middle class, and female, intersects with an increasingly diverse student population, creating a need for culturally responsive teaching practices, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) classes. An investigation of existing literature reveals the need for greater emphasis on environmental racism and social justice as they pertain to students living in low-income and urban communities. Our findings reveal that CRS can be utilized in a collective effort to transform teacher education programs and teacher pedagogy, to effectively address environmental racism and other social justice issues in urban schools and communities.

ID YOUNG-PEOPLE; CITIZENSHIP; REFUGEES; RACISM
AB Australian multiculturalism emerged as national policy in the 1970s following contentious immigration policies designed to limit the entry of non-white immigrants. Multiculturalism frames articulations of national belonging in terms of broad moral implications and the immigration policy from which such implications stem. Paradoxically, discourses central to the multicultural ideal, such as integration and tolerance, can act to limit people's experience of social belonging by providing scope for demonstrations of Anglo-Celtic heritage as a form of symbolic capital. I explore the ways non-white young people with refugee backgrounds interpret whiteness in relation to multiculturalism and negotiate their sense of belonging in Brisbane, Australia. I discuss the link between whiteness and multiculturalism from the perspectives of these young people and demonstrate the various ways in which they interpret Australian national belonging as intrinsically linked to skin color. By alternately highlighting and evading their own racialized sense of themselves, young people exhibit a multiplicity of possibilities for belonging and respond to the political context of their own lives.

AB Jean Raspail's controversial 1973 novelThe camp of the saintspredicts mass migration to Europe that will destroy European civilization. Decades later, the book has accurately predicted the hundreds of thousands of refugees arriving in Europe annually, prompting a continent-wide crisis. From Lesbos and Lampedusa to the Canary Islands and Calais, no one seems to know how to stem the flow of humanity. Borders are being resurrected, despite Schengen and European Union (EU) agreements, in an effort to control the movement of populations. European governments disagree on how to proceed and some are suggesting that the EU could be torn apart by differing approaches to the problem. But does this have to be the response to the migration crisis? This paper compares the predictions ofThe camp of the saintsto events in Europe today and critiques the book's conclusions with regard to what is an ancient phenomenon: movements of migrants from surplus to deficit labor settings. The paper will also evaluate the response to migrants in the United States under its populist president, Donald Trump, and will review related issues in other parts of the world: Turkey, Russia, and Canada. Contrary to Raspail's predictions, world leaders will need to accept what has already become a de facto reality: large scale admission of migrants and refugees to the EU and North America, as full citizens, will be the only realistic way to preserve prosperity in the years to come.

DT Article
DE Linguistic boundaries; Decoloniality; Indigenous women; Critical
   Discourse Analysis
AB Individuals who speak different languages carry with them social, cultural, ethnic and often divergent representations of the world and the other. The relationships they establish with the surrounding society are constituted by a complex and dynamic network of rules and conventions that go beyond the individual and determine them with intensity. When confronted, they produce discursive methods and strategies to guarantee the acquisition of another language and their own existence. The aim of this study is to analyze how two indigenous women, Wai-wai (PA) and Apinaye (TO), express power and resistance in discursive and social practices to ensure knowledge and the acquisition of a second language. This is a study with a focus on Critical Discourse Analysis, based on approximations with the Post-Colonial and Decolonial theoretical currents, with regard to epistemological criticism. The results show that linguistic factors cannot be understood in isolation from social clashes, since violence, racism, prejudice and intolerance against indigenous women stem from the degree of difference and power relations between cultures and languages. It is evident in their social and discursive practices a place of position of power and resistance, mobilized by the needs of social insertion.

AB This article explores the attitudes and beliefs of 38 people who made claims ofanti-white racismin a national survey that measured the extent and variation of racism in Australia. Quantitative analysis of survey data reveals that those who make claims of anti-white racism are nearly twice as likely as the rest of population to hold negative views about cultural diversity and immigration, to identify 'out-groups', and to self-identify as racist. They are also much less likely to recognise the existence of white privilege in Australia. Discourse analysis of these participants' open-ended survey responses reveals their attitudes stem from a belief that their white national identity, and the privilege and ownership that accompanies this, is under threat. They view this 'threat' as a form of racism they are victims of. These discourses of anti-white racism reflect key mechanisms of institutional racism, in particular white privilege.

AB Research on stigma by prejudice transfer has demonstrated that White women anticipate sexism when interacting with a racist individual due to a belief that prejudices stem from an underlying ideology of group inequality. The present research proposes that individuals' lay theory of generalized prejudice (LTGP) varies across individuals and examines cardiovascular stress responses (high frequency heart rate variability [HF-HRV] and preejection period [PEP]). White women who held a lay theory of generalized prejudice and were evaluated by a White man with negative attitudes towards Black Americans demonstrated greater cardiovascular reactivity (decreases in parasympathetic activity [Studies 1 and 2] and shortened PEP [Study 2] from baseline to evaluation) than White women being evaluated by a neutral evaluator or who did not hold a lay theory of generalized prejudice. The present studies are the first to demonstrate cardiovascular stress responses to stigma by prejudice transfer and to highlight LTGP as a key individual difference in stigma by prejudice transfer.

AB Many science, technology, engineering, and math degrees require passing an ntroductory physics course. Physics courses often have high failure rates that disproportionately harm students who are historically and continually marginalized by racism, sexism, and classism. We examined the associations between learning assistant (LA) supported courses and equity in nonpassing grades [i.e., drop, fail, or withdrawal (DFW)] in introductory physics courses. The data used in the study came from 2312 students in 41 sections of introductory physics courses at a regional Hispanic serving institution. We developed hierarchical generalized linear models of student DFW rates that accounted for gender, race, first-generation status, and LA-supported instruction. We used a quantitative critical race theory (QuantCrit) perspective focused on the role of hegemonic power structures in perpetuating inequitable student outcomes. Our QuantCrit perspective informed our research questions, methods, and interpretations of findings. The models associated LAs with overall decreases in DFW rates and larger decreases in DFW rates for Black, Indigenous, and people of color than their White peers. While the inequities in DFW rates were lower in LA-supported courses, they were still present.

TI Israel-UN Relations: Three Phases and Three Questions
SO ISRAEL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB An in-depth historical examination of relations between Israel and the United Nations reveals three distinct periods. The first (1947-55) was characterized by reciprocal trust and fulfillment of mutual expectations. The second (1956-90) was marked by constant crises, mistrust, and hostility, which peaked with the 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism. The salient feature of the third period (1990 to the present) is a process of normalization with ups and downs. Israel is increasingly regarded by UN members as part of the family of nations, and the attitude towards it has become more balanced. Given the vacillations in UN-Israel relations during the organization's first seventy years, the following three questions may lead to a better assessment of the import of these relations]: A. What provokes so many anti-Israel resolutions and do they stem from anti-Semitism?; B. Does the road to peace necessitate a "UN bypass"?; C. How might Israel be integrated in future UN projects?

AB This research explored the development of Black adolescents' (N = 454) critical reflection, conceived as individual (i.e., blaming Black people) and structural (i.e., blaming systemic racism) attributions for race achievement gaps. In this longitudinal study, adolescents and their parents reported their individual and structural attributions for race achievement gaps and parents' racial socialization. Adolescents' structural attributions increased from Grade 10 to Grade 12. Average levels of individual attributions did not change. Adolescents' reports of parental racial socialization and parents' structural attributions when youth were in Grade 10 predicted increases in adolescents' structural attributions. Findings are applied to future research and efforts to increase adolescent critical reflection.

ID TURKS
AB This study explores the circumstances of Kurdish refugee youth in Canada. Using a critical ethnographic approach, I interviewed twenty young people, aged 15-30, to examine their transnational identities and lived experiences in the Canadian context. Arendt's notion of the right to have rights, Isin's concept of acts of citizenship, and Hall's concept of state hegemony proved to be useful theoretical tools to examine the exclusion of refugee youth from the educational market and their statelessness, rightlessness, and statuslessness in the nation-states. The interview data indicate that the statelessness and statuslessness of refugee youth stem from the practices of hegemony, assimilation, and racism by their home and host state. The study also suggests the importance of questioning the state's hegemony and the domination of the western construction of citizenship to provide alternative forms of social and educational participation that can transform the youths' status from refugees to actors and citizens.

DE racialization; racism; ethnic borders; social work; special education;
   Mayotte; Overseas France; postcolonial; intersectionality
AB In the aftermath of the transformation of Mayotte's legal status into a French overseas administrative departement in 2011, local public policy has become increasingly institutionalized and normalized, particularly in the field of social policies, which were previously optional and residual due to colonial history. The major principles of division and hierarchies that stem from this history-race, gender, and nationality-have not disappeared. Rather, they have changed over time, following the tremendous historical evolutions the Comoro Archipelago has faced. Public policies have played a tremendous role in these changes due to the new rules they set and the resources they allocate.
   Focusing on the social work sector, this paper deals with logics of racialization within public policy by comparing the biographies and the standpoints of social workers, forewomen, and leaders in this non-profit sector, be they in a minoritarian or a majoritarian situation. How are these logics of racialization reproduced, experienced, appropriated, and sometimes disputed by professionals who occupy contrasted, if not antagonistic, social positions?

ID GENDER
AB We investigated the intersectional nature of race/racism and gender/sexism in broad scale inequities in physics student learning using a critical quantitative intersectionality. To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.

AB With a spatial analytical framework, we study Take Back the Night demonstrations as a way of mobilizing for safety and claiming the right to the city. The marches are a symbolic display of women's distress about living in fear of violence. It is a critique of society's inability to handle the problem of prevailing gendered power relations and the unequal access to city spaces that stem from these. The aim of this paper is to examine feminist struggles to challenge gendered spatial power relations, focusing on Take Back the Night mobilization. Hence, this qualitative study focuses Take Back the Night demonstrations as a phenomenon and as an actual spatial strategy, by analysing representations regarding Take Back the Night in Sweden at large, and in Malmo, Sweden's third largest city, in particular. We discuss feminist efforts to create temporary safe spaces in terms of the demonstrations' emancipatory potential and how these spatial claims provoke resistance. The demonstrations and the reactions they create reveal existing inequalities and power structures.

ID STEM EDUCATION; CHICAGO
AB This article examines the tensions that arose as teachers, scientists, youth, and community organizers worked to develop a curriculum that was responsive to community concerns and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Within the context of urban heavy metal contamination and building on previous critiques of the standards, we identified how the ideological commitments of the NGSS hinder their applicability to community issues. We examine latent ideological commitments in the performance expectations (PEs) and disciplinary core ideas as they relate to historical and present causes and consequences of urban heavy metal contamination. Whereas the scientific enterprise and chemical industry produce harms and benefits, the NGSS focus on benefits and ignore that both harms and benefits of science are unevenly distributed. Given the pressure on teachers to implement the NGSS, this paper presents examples from collaborative curriculum development efforts that meet PEs while pushing students to ask critical questions and engage with their communities to challenge the standards' alignment with the chemical industry. Ultimately, we argue that the NGSS position teachers as promoters of the status quo of the scientific enterprise and we document possibilities for the role of science teachers in US schools that are more transformative.

AB Teachers involved in a Master's level course in diversity participated in virtual, synchronous, anonymized discussions around issues of ethnic and racial diversity, gender, and stereotypes that could impact their students' participation in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Guided by theoretical frameworks from Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), a convenience sample of 14 science and mathematics teachers participated in a series of virtual chats using open-ended questioning and facilitated by two university instructors. Using conversation and critical discourse analyses, three primary themes emerged: understanding of issues related to stereotypes, encouragement of females and minorities to pursue careers in STEM, and the place for diversity discussions in science and mathematics classrooms. The teachers felt burdened by curricular and administrative constraints that inhibit their ability to participate in thought-provoking critical conversations. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways teachers can assist in the STEM career identity development of their underrepresented females and students of color and calls for research that combines the key findings in SCCT and CRT to build confidence and capacity for teachers to effectively confront issues of racism, sexism, and stereotyping in science and mathematics classrooms.

AB Current literature on patient-physician concordance emphasizes its advantages. Racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic concordance was found to impact patient-physician communication positively and to lead to improved healthcare quality and outcomes. Patients' preference for ethnic discordance, on the other hand, appears anomalous and has barely been studied. The present research sought to evaluate the rates of patients from the Jewish majority and the Arab minority populations in Israel who prefer patient-physician ethnic discordance, and to examine the reasons for this preference. A mixed method methodology was employed: a survey (n = 760; 505 Jews, 255 Arabs), as well an exploratory qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 38 Jewish and Arab patients in Israel. The survey's findings indicate that Arabs are more likely to prefer to be treated by a Jewish physician than are Jews to prefer an Arab physician (family physician - 4.3% vs. 0.4%, p < .0001; surgeon - 5.9% vs. 0.8%, p < .0001). The difference is age-dependent: young Arabs are more likely than older ones to prefer a Jewish physician. The reasons for Arabs' preference for a Jewish physician are fear of a breach of confidentiality, and internalized racism. The reasons for Jews' preference for an Arab physician are the disposition and professionalism attributed to the latter, which are perceived to stem from their need, as a minority population, to excel and to prove themselves. Despite the emphasis placed in scholarship and clinical practice on the importance of cultural and linguistic competency in healthcare, a preference for ethnic discordance should also be taken into account, especially regarding patients from minority collectivist populations.

AB This qualitative study explores how Black students in community college developmental mathematics navigate stereotypes about their abilities and succeed. I apply stereotype management, a conceptual framework typically used to explain how minoritized groups in K-12 settings and universities succeed despite negative labeling. Using data from a narrative study about Black students who succeeded in developmental mathematics, this study features eight participants (two females and six males) and reveals (a) implicit and explicit offenses endured from faculty and peers in math classrooms; (b) behaviors prompting management practices; and (c) strategies employed to navigate the offenses. Results suggest that despite participants' ability to navigate discriminatory behaviors, emotional stressors shaped their perceptions about the treatment Black students withstand in these courses. Implications address negative relations between Black students and their Latinx peers and faculty and provide strategies to support students, particularly those whose mathematics abilities are questioned.

AB This article analyzes the role of STEM initiatives designed by city and corporate elites in a large urban district and outlines an alternative, grassroots vision for (STEM) education and city schools. Within a neoliberal context of gentrification, displacement, disinvestment, and privatization, STEM schools have become strategic components of Chicago's 'portfolio district' that serve the interests of racial capitalism in three ways. First, STEM schools provide a claim to fairness in the midst of racist school closures. Second, STEM high schools are a corporate strategy for racially stratified labor force preparation that restricts curriculum and reifies tracking. Third, curriculum restriction prioritizes corporate interests over students' capacity to shape their communities and the world. The authors draw on the wisdom of Chicago communities who have led resistance against corporate education reform to critique Chicago STEM policy and point to critical mathematics and science education as part of a model for sustainable community schools.

AB The article analyzes the particular contexts in which families that adopted children from other countries and racial groups negotiate the challenges posed by the "transracial adoption paradox": the contradictions in daily social interaction that stem from the dual social position of the children vis-a-vis their host/adopting society. While enjoying the privileges associated with living in families belonging to the racial and ethnic hegemonic group, these children are, at the same time, potentially vulnerable to the kind of discrimination and social stigmatization endured by racial minorities. The data have been extracted from the "Adoptive families and their lifestyles" survey (2012) and are based on a questionnaire answered by 230 Spanish interracial families who adopted children abroad. The results show how adoptive parents tend to put in practice socialization patterns close to assimilation/acculturation into the mainstream culture, while reproducing at the same time the ideology of colorblind racism.

TI "I Know I Have to Work Twice as Hard and Hope That Makes Me Good
   Enough": Exploring the Stress and Strain of Black Doctoral Students in
   Engineering and Computing
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; JOHN-HENRYISM; RACE; MATHEMATICS; FACULTY; GENDER;
   MICROAGGRESSIONS; MOTIVATION; DIVERSITY; SCIENCE
AB Background/Context: It is well documented that Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience more stress and strain during doctoral training than their White and Asian peers. However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students.
   We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from. first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions.
   Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus getup Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twenty-three participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using open-ended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently.
   Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings.
   Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs.
   The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt.
   The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal.

AB The majority of studies investigating the relationship between racism/racial discrimination and birth outcomes have focused on perceived experiences of racism/racial discrimination directed at oneself (personal racism). However, evidence suggests individuals report with greater frequency racism/racial discrimination directed at friends, family members, or other members of their racial/ethnic group (group racism). We examined how much African American (AA) women report lifetime experiences of perceived racism or racial discrimination, both personal and group, varied by maternal age. We also investigated whether reports of personal and group racism/racial discrimination were associated with the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant and how much maternal age in relation to developmental life stages (adolescence [18years], emerging adulthood [19-24years], and adulthood [25years]) moderated the relationship. Data stem from the Baltimore Preterm Birth Study, a hybrid prospective/retrospective cohort study that enrolled 872 women between March 2000 and July 2004 (analyzed in 2016-2017). Spline regression analyses demonstrated a statistically significant (p value for overall association <0.001) and non-linear (p value=0.044) relationship between maternal age and the overall racism index. Stratified analysis showed experiences of racism overall was associated with a higher odds ratio of delivering an SGA infant among AA women aged 25years (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.08). The overall racism index was not associated with the SGA infant odds ratio for emerging adults (OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.06) or adolescents (OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.66-1.28). Multiple aspects of racism and the intersection between racism and other contextual factors need to be considered.

AB There is a peculiar problem in the US that is proving to challenge core values that undergird our laws, interpersonal interactions, and challenge the civil rights of many. American society believes in harsh sentences for committing crimes without a system for rehabilitation from crime and absent from resources from a community level to prevent crimes. As crime has declined since the 1990s, policing behavior has grown to a level that reflects a disregard for humanity resulting in police-involved shootings, also known as "justifiable homicides" or deaths by legal intervention. This peculiar problem reifies old notions of racial inferiority and racial profiling that stem from a long history of lynchings in America, and highlights a broken legal system that shows bias toward poor communities and communities not of the racial and ethnic majority. When laws support one racial or ethnic group and those with resources, other communities become invisible and subjected to state-sanctioned violence that allows some police agencies and police officers to engage in behaviors that do not reflect their training foster an overwhelming sense of fear in these communities. We have observed that when communities fear the police and the larger society disbelieves the negative interactions with police, residents have begun to capture police encounters with community members on social media. Despite the video footage that has been collected documenting abuse of power, some police have been granted impunity for their actions, which further fuels fear in these communities. What we propose are ways to frame and solve negative police encounters with communities through an understanding of: (1) racial biases; (2) racial and gender consciousness; (3) ways to provide more equitable policing practices; (4) the enforcement of legal remedies for those who abuse power; and (5) the prevention of acts of discrimination by holding individuals culpable who informally police Black males. We believe these strategies aid in addressing the historical legacy of these behaviors and moves multiple systems and disciplines toward integrated solutions to eliminate "justifiable homicides."

AB The recruitment and retention of Black STEM teachers is a nation-wide challenge for the field of teacher education. In this chapter, we start to unpack the recruitment and retention challenges faced by Vanderbilt's Noyce STEM teacher education program. We share the analysis of lived-experience interviews from two Black teacher candidates who earned their STEM degrees from an HBCU (Fisk University) and then transitioned to a PWI (Vanderbilt University) to earn their master's in education (M.Ed.) degree. The analysis of their lived experiences revealed four themes: (a) the need for more visible partnerships between the HBCU and PWI; (b) the identification of mentors for scholar success; (c) the investigation for understanding Black teacher candidates as role models for their students; and (d) the institutionalized racism that still challenges Black teacher candidates at PWIs. These findings have implications for how programs situated within a PWI might consider the recruitment and retention of Black mathematics and science teachers.

AB Indigenous people experience significant health disparities compared to non-Indigenous people, which are exacerbated by less accessible and poorer quality health care services. This research aimed to understand the specific barriers to health care that Indigenous patients and their families face, as well as to explore promising practices and strategies for improving the responsiveness of health services to the needs of Indigenous people. Through qualitative interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous health care and social services providers, we identified a range of challenges and successful approaches, and developed recommendations for improving policy and practice to address the gaps in culturally safe health care services. Our study shows that many of the barriers Indigenous people face when accessing health care are rooted in the broader social determinants of health, such as poverty, racism, housing, and education. These are complex problems that are outside of the traditional scope of health care practice. However, this study has also demonstrated that many barriers to equitable care actually stem from within the health care system itself. We found that health care gaps were often attributable to poorly funded on-reserve health care services and culturally unsafe off-reserve services. Attitudes and practices among those working in health care and gaps in coordination between mainstream and Indigenous services are challenges related to the way the health care system operates. Solutions are needed that address these issues. Given the multifaceted nature of access barriers, strategies to improve health services for Indigenous people and communities require a comprehensive and systemic approach.

AB Scholarship that jointly considers disability and development has advanced over the past decade to include greater attention to the shared histories of colonialism, racism, and the disability category and the relationships among developmental states, ideas about disability, and development projects. A handful of geographers have also directly addressed disability and development or disability in the "developing world" context. This paper reviews current scholarship and highlights three areas where disability studies and development geography share under-explored empirical connections and theoretical resonances: the disability-poverty nexus, interventions in the name of improvement and cure, and mobility and migration. Yet bringing greater attention to disability in development must be done carefully, given the fraught nature of the disability category. As such, this paper also considers how development geographers might contribute to the literature while accounting for the ways in which ideas about what constitutes "disability" and what constitutes "development" emerge through sets of processes and relationships.

AB Almost 1.7 million people in the settler colonial nation of Canada identify as Indigenous. Approximately 52 per cent of Indigenous peoples in Canada live in urban areas. In spite of high rates of urbanization, urban Indigenous peoples are overlooked in health care policy and services. Because of this, although health care services are more plentiful in cities as compared to rural areas, Indigenous people still report significant barriers to health care access in urban settings. This qualitative study, undertaken in Prince George, Canada, examines perceived barriers to health care access for urban Indigenous people in light of how colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples in their everyday lives. The three most frequently reported barriers to health care access on the part of the 65 participating health care providers and Indigenous clients of health care services are: substandard quality of care; long wait times; and experiences of racism and discrimination. These barriers, some of which are common complaints among the general population in Canada, are interpreted by Indigenous clients in unique ways rooted in experiences of discrimination and exclusion that stem from the settler colonial context of the nation. Through the lenses of cultural safety and ethical space frameworks developed by international Indigenous scholars in efforts to better understand and operationalize relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and societies in the context of settler colonialism this study offers an understanding of these barriers in light of the specific ways that colonialism intrudes into Indigenous clients' access to care on an everyday basis.

AB This forum paper dialogues with Sheron Mark's A bit of both science and economics: a non-traditional STEM identity narrative. In her paper, she discusses the development of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) identity by a young African American male during an informal STEM for Social Justice Program. Here, the discussion focuses on Black masculinities, identity formation, and the role of science educators in making STEM fields a welcoming place for young Black men. Drawing from Mark's data and discussion, this paper is a dialogue between science identity possibilities in the United States and in Brazil when we look at the intersections of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using the shared colonial past of both countries a connection is established to address race relations within science education. The main argument in this paper is that racism can no longer be denied and dismissed by the science education community worldwide and that intersectional approaches are needed to face this issue.

AB The proportion of Black, Latinx, and American Native individuals annually earning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral degrees in the United States (US) has been enduringly and inequitably low for decades compared to their White peers. Despite the intransigent connection between race and STEM doctoral outcomes, US STEM education policy documents typically fail to identify racism as influencing this racial inequity. This paper presents critical capital theory (CCT)-an integration of critical race theory, forms of capital, and fictive kinship-to give racism full explanatory power within the context of US STEM doctoral outcomes. CCT proposes that access to large and affluent social networks containing supportive individuals who have knowledge of how to successfully navigate institutions of power is currently core to STEM doctoral success. This access reinforces STEM identity and belonging, but has been and continues to be primarily preserved for White students via an ever-evolving system of racism. CCT proposes systems supporting STEM faculty's consistent provision of high-quality mentorship experiences for all their students-coupled with accountability for providing this mentorship-would result in more equitable STEM doctoral outcomes.

DT Article
ID BLACK; LANGUAGE
AB In this article, I propose Critical Race English Education (CREE) as a theoretical and pedagogical construct that tackles white supremacy and anti-black racism within English education and ELA classrooms. I employ autoethnography and counterstorytelling as methods that center my multiple identities and lived realities as I document my racialized and gendered experiences in relation to my journey to Ferguson, MO and my experiences as a secondary ELA teacher. The research questions guiding this study are the following: (I) As a Black male English educator and language and literacy scholar, how am I implicated in the struggle for racial justice and what does it mean for me to teach literacy in our present-day justice movement?; (2) How are Black lives mattering in ELA classrooms?; and, (3) How are we using Black youth life histories and experiences to inform our mindset, curriculum, and pedagogical practices in the classroom? This article explicates findings from three interconnected stories that work to show how CREE can be operationalized to better understand the #BlackLivesMatter movement in its historical and contemporary dimensions. The data analyzed stem from my autobiographical narratives, observations, social media artifacts, and images. I aim to expand English education to be more synergistically attuned to racial justice issues dealing with police brutality, the mass incarceration of Black people, and legacies of grassroots activism. This analysis suggests implications that aim to move the pedagogical practices around the intersections of anti-blackness and literacy from the margins to the center of discussion and praxis in ELA contexts.

AB This article examines one strategy in the discursive construction of so-called reverse racism: the slur-once-removed, a linguistic construction in the form the X-word, used to euphemize slurs. Building on structural similarity to the N-word, the C-word has emerged as a euphemism for cracker. Using dialogic syntax and stance theory, the article analyzes media debates surrounding the George Zimmerman murder trial to argue that the parallelism of form between the C-word and the N-word constructs their referents as similarly harmful. Euphemizing cracker as the C-word indexes cracker as a racist slur, and by extension discursively constructs the phenomenon of reverse racism.

AB This study examines the use of humour by Black football coaches in England as a rhetorical device against racism. The paper draws on humour studies and critical race theory to illustrate signs of humour as defence. Research on humour has popularly explored the ambiguities and qualities of humour and, in particular, joke telling through its use as a foil to stem racial ills is less well understood. Where previous work has focused on explicit joke telling/banter in sport, this paper examines how techniques of humour are used in everyday racialised experiences. The use of techniques of humour enables feelings of subordination, and humiliation to be transposed into forms of resistance, while its physiological and psychological benefits can lead to inter-racial relief and catharsis. The paper concludes that techniques of humour remain underexplored as important tools of resistance to everyday racism.

AB Existent research indicates that postsecondary Black faculty members, who are sorely underrepresented in the academy especially in STEM fields, assume essential roles; chief among these roles is diversifying higher education. Their recruitment and retention become more challenging in light of research findings on work life for postsecondary faculty. Research has shown that postsecondary faculty members in general have become increasingly stressed and job satisfaction has declined with dissatisfaction with endeavors and work overload cited as major stressors. In addition to the stresses managed by higher education faculty at large, Black faculty must navigate diversity-related challenges. Illuminating and understanding their experiences can be instrumental in lessening stress and job dissatisfaction, outcomes that facilitate recruitment and retention. This study featured the experiences and perceptions of Black faculty in science education. This study, framed by critical race theory, examines two questions: What characterizes the work life of some Black faculty members who teach, research, and serve in science education? How are race and racism present in the experiences of these postsecondary Black faculty members? A phenomenological approach to the study situates the experiences of the Black participants as valid phenomena worthy of investigation, illuminates their experiences, and seeks to retain the authenticity of their voices.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), commonly known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy tissue and organs. Characteristic of the disease is a disproportionate effect on women and communities of color, both in terms of prevalence and severity of symptoms. Lupus is also both genetically driven and subject to external environmental conditions, many with place based corollaries. Thus, lupus presents a series of complex and intersecting biosocial questions regarding its origin and treatment, questions which transdisciplinary approaches are uniquely suited to address. In this paper, we propose a framework, incorporating critical approaches to the production of embodied formations of race and gender as well as new understandings of the impact of environmental conditions and lived experience at the genetic level, that can direct future research into lupus that is both more inclusive of a range of influences and more precise in its ability to treat and diagnose the disease.

AB This paper examines historical and contemporary racializations of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system. The prevailing perception of Asian(Americans) as model minorities masks how their multiple and contradictory positionings in the STEM system perpetuate the neoliberal racial project and reproduce systems of racism and oppression. Through a multidisciplinary analysis of STEM education and industry, we demonstrate that the shifting racialization of Asian(Americans) secures advantages for White Americans by promoting meritocracy and producerism and justifies White supremacy. By serving these functions, the racialization of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system is central to the neoliberal racial project. This paper also suggests how STEM education researchers can reveal and resist, rather than veil and support, the neoliberal racial project in STEM.

AB Social media are influential sociocultural forces that construct and transmit information about gender, health and bodies to young people in the digital age. In health and physical activity, Chinese people are often represented and positioned differently to other (minority) ethnic groups. For example, Black young people are often understood as having low academic motivations and aspirations but as natural' athletes; in contrast, Chinese young people, seen as the model minority' who excel in STEM subjects, are fragile, reserved and disinterested in physical movements. These public forms of representation may sit in opposition to the young people's embodied identity. When these misrepresentations are internalised, issues such as micro-aggression and racism may have an impact on Chinese young people's health and wellbeing. This paper aims to examine how Chinese bodies are gendered and racialised in contemporary social media sites (e.g. Google News, LiveJournal, Medium, Wordpress). Drawing on critical discourse analysis and Foucault's concepts of normalisation and discursive practice, the paper will problematise the often taken-for-granted gendered and racialised stereotypes related to Chinese physicality and health on social media sites. Implications for developing future research and teaching resources in critical media health literacy for young people on issues related to gender and equity will be provided. The results affect how we understand, represent, and discuss Chinese (young) people on social media sites, thereby how Chinese young people engage, construct, and perform their embodied identities in Western, English speaking societies.

AB A group of 3 African American female preservice science and science teaching students majoring in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) participated in a qualitative research study to share their experiences in STEM, reasons for their choice of major, obstacles and challenges, instances of racism or sexism, and their identity development. The students participated in semistructured, face-to-face interviews. The results showed that the females were not discouraged by their underrepresentation; were confident in their abilities; and expressed wide variation in their identity development related to race, gender, and field of study. Future studies should seek deeper insights into how STEM college student identities are developed and solidified in the predominantly White and male STEM culture.

AB In this study, we explored how science teacher candidates construct ideas about science teaching and learning in the context of partnerships with urban community-based organizations. We used a case study design focusing on a group of 10 preservice teachers' participation in educational programming that focused on environmental racism and connected science to larger social issues in an economically dispossessed Mexican community in Chicago. Using theoretical lenses of humanistic science education, justice-centered science pedagogy, and structure-agency dialectic, we studied how preservice high school science teachers made sense of equity and social justice issues facing marginalized communities and how they thought about the goals and nature of science education, along with their role as science teachers, as they participated in a Toxic Tour provided by the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. By emphasizing both environmental challenges and the community assets in Little Village, the Toxic Tour provided an opportunity for science teacher candidates to develop a complex understanding of this particular community and critically reflect on their own communities. The teacher candidates identified both structures that are enabling or disabling for community members and people's individual and collective agency acting upon these structures. They also recognized communities as places of authentic science learning.

ID INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; LEARNING-DISABILITY
AB Objectives. To estimate the cumulative probability (c) of arrest by age 28 years in the United States by disability status, race/ethnicity, and gender.
   Methods. I estimated cumulative probabilities through birth cohort life tables with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997.
   Results. Estimates demonstrated that those with disabilities have a higher cumulative probability of arrest (c = 42.65) than those without (c = 29.68). The risk was disproportionately spread across races/ethnicities, with Blacks with disabilities experiencing the highest cumulative probability of arrest (c = 55.17) and Whites without disabilities experiencing the lowest (c = 27.55). Racial/ethnic differences existed by gender as well. There was a similar distribution of disability types across race/ethnicity, suggesting that the racial/ethnic differences in arrest may stem from racial/ethnic inequalities as opposed to differential distribution of disability types.
   Conclusions. The experience of arrest for those with disabilities was higher than expected. Police officers should understand how disabilities may affect compliance and other behaviors, and likewise how implicit bias and structural racism may affect reactions and actions of officers and the systems they work within in ways that create inequities.

ID FACULTY
AB The strength of every nation lies in its people. In America, that strength can be found in the rich cultural heritage of a diverse nation. Unfortunately, diversity does not permeate all facets of life-specifically in academia and its libraries. The question continues to be asked: where are all of the academic librarians of color? For the ones who are tenured or who are seeking tenure, how can they be retained within the ranks of academia? The focus of this study is to explore and define some of the explicit and implicit barriers faced by academic librarians of color through a review of the literature. Many of the explicit barriers stem directly from racism and from being perceived as the "other" while implicit barriers are more subtle and stem from the covert damage that toxic environmental forces have on shaping the career and work experiences of librarians of color. This analysis also offers methods for breaking down these barriers (through ways such as mentoring) for institutions to consider along with some strategies to empower librarians of color themselves.

AB Williams and O'Reilly (1998) published a seminal review of diversity research that has become a classic resource for researchers and practitioners alike. In the current review, we update the theoretical record by discussing traditional views of, as well as recent developments to, the 3 prominent frameworks used to understand diversity: social categorization, similarity-attraction, and information and decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a dual pathway model of diversity's effects that integrates all 3 frameworks. In our model, both positive and detrimental effects of diversity stem from processes of social categorization. Whereas these processes disrupt group functioning when intergroup bias is activated, when bias is not activated, we propose that social categorization and reduced attraction to dissimilar others will allow individuals in diverse rather than homogeneous groups to focus more on the task, anticipate differences in task-relevant opinions and perspectives, and engage in more effortful information processing. Finding the balance is key.

AB Rationale: Research suggests that, among Whites, racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes. However, little is known about whether racial bias predicts ingroup health outcomes among minority populations.
   Objective: The aim of the current research was to understand whether racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes for Blacks.
   Method: We compiled racial bias responses from 250,665 Blacks and 1,391,632 Whites to generate county-level estimates of Blacks' and Whites' implicit and explicit biases towards each other. We then examined the degree to which these biases predicted ingroup death rate from circulatory-related diseases.
   Results: In counties where Blacks harbored more implicit bias towards Whites, Blacks died at a higher rate. Additionally, consistent with previous research, in counties where Whites harbored more explicit bias towards Blacks, Whites died at a higher rate. These links between racial bias and ingroup death rate were independent of county-level socio-demographic characteristics, and racial biases from the out-group in the same county.
   Conclusion: Findings indicate that racial bias is related to negative ingroup health outcomes for both Blacks and Whites, though this relationship is driven by implicit bias for Blacks, and explicit bias for Whites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At some point most Black and Latino/a college studentseven long-term high achieversquestion their own abilities because of multiple forms of racial bias. The 38 high-achieving Black and Latino/a STEM study participants, who attended institutions with racially hostile academic spaces, deployed an arsenal of strategies (e.g., stereotype management) to deflect stereotyping and other racial assaults (e.g., racial microaggressions), which are particularly prevalent in STEM fields. These students rely heavily on coping strategies that alter their authentic racial identities but create internal turmoil. Institutions of higher education, including minority-serving schools, need to examine institutional racism and other structural barriers that damage the racial identities of Black and Latino/a students in STEM and cause lasting psychological strain.

TI Toxic Residents: Health and Citizenship at Love Canal
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; PROTECTION
AB This article investigates the relationship between American political culture and grassroots environmentalism in the 1970s. To do so, it examines how the white working class residents of Love Canal, New York, claimed health and a healthy environment as rights of citizenship. To date, the Canal has remained a sore spot for environmental scholarship; this article demonstrates how the analytic difficulties posed by the Canal stem from the crosscurrents of American political culture in the late 1970s. Canal residents put their local experience into several larger frames of reference: the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, the plight of Cuban and Vietnamese refugees, and a culture of skepticism toward government and medical authority. Residents' use of these frameworks illustrates two broader points about American political culture in the late 1970s. First, the claim to health as a right rather than a privilege, articulated by health radicals throughout the 1960s, had by the late 1970s been decoupled from its origins in left-liberal struggles. Second, the crosscurrents of localism, nativism, racism, and anti-authoritarianism characteristic of the reactionary populism of urban working-class whites could, quite logically for their proponents, co-exist with rights-based claims to health and a healthy environment. Love Canal demands that we embed our narratives about the development of environmental politics-environmental justice in particular-within a broader story about deregulation, the rise of the New Right, and the political and economic marginalization of the working class in the United States.

TI Race-Conscious Professionalism and African American Representation in
   Academic Medicine
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MINORITY PHYSICIANS; CARE
AB African Americans remain substantially less likely than other physicians to hold academic appointments. The roots of these disparities stem from different extrinsic and intrinsic forces that guide career development. Efforts to ameliorate African American underrepresentation in academic medicine have traditionally focused on modifying structural and extrinsic barriers through undergraduate and graduate outreach, diversity and inclusion initiatives at medical schools, and faculty development programs. Although essential, these initiatives fail to confront the unique intrinsic forces that shape career development. America's ignoble history of violence, racism, and exclusion exposes African American physicians to distinct personal pressures and motivations that shape professional development and career goals. This article explores these intrinsic pressures with a focus on their historical roots; reviews evidence of their effect on physician development; and considers the implications of these trends for improving African American representation in academic medicine. The paradigm of "race-conscious professionalism" is used to understand the dual obligation encountered by many minority physicians not only to pursue excellence in their field but also to leverage their professional stature to improve the well-being of their communities. Intrinsic motivations introduced by race-conscious professionalism complicate efforts to increase the representation of minorities in academic medicine. For many African American physicians, a desire to have their work focused on the community will be at odds with traditional paths to professional advancement. Specific policy options are discussed that would leverage race-conscious professionalism as a draw to a career in academic medicine, rather than a force that diverts commitment elsewhere.

AB Little is known about Black-White health inequalities in Canada or the applicability of competing explanations for them. To address this gap, we used nine cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey to analyze multiple health outcomes in a sample of 3,127 Black women, 309,720 White women, 2,529 Black men and 250,511 White men. Adjusting for age, marital status, urban/rural residence and immigrant status, Black women and men were more likely than their White counterparts to report diabetes and hypertension, Black women were less likely than White women to report cancer and fair/poor mental health and Black men were less likely than White men to report heart disease. These health inequalities persisted after controlling for education, household income, smoking, physical activity and body-mass index. We conclude that high rates of diabetes and hypertension among Black Canadians may stem from experiences of racism in everyday life, low rates of heart disease and cancer among Black Canadians may reflect survival bias and low rates of fair/poor mental health among Black Canadian women represent a mental health paradox similar to the one that exists for African Americans in the United States.

AB Drawing on a secularist view of religion as primarily a private matter for individuals, the international discourse on human rights has historically considered alternative bodies of law and legal reasoning to be inherently suspect. This 'secularist suspicion' has been particularly pronounced towards religious and customary forms of law, which are commonly seen as challenges to the sovereignty and hegemony of human rights law. Through a close reading of the practice of United Nations committees monitoring racism and women's rights from 1993 to 2010, the development of a gradual divergence in their views of legal pluralism is explored. It is suggested that these views stem from different understandings of what religion is and should be in law, politics and society. Left unattended, this divergence may threaten the conceptual unity and holism of the human rights enterprise.

AB The existing literature does not focus on risk-taking differences within females and how these differences may influence academic choices in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The current project examined differences in academic risk-taking between STEM and non-STEM female students. A total of 272 undergraduates from 3 universities in the United States participated in a total of 2 studies. Results from the first and second studies indicated differences between STEM and non-STEM females in academic risk-taking. Future studies should explore these academic risk-taking differences between STEM and non-STEM female students.

ID EXPERIENCES; PERSISTENCE; STUDENTS
AB We conducted a mixed-methods study of matriculation issues for African-Americans in the STEM pipeline. The project compares the experiences of students currently majoring in science (N = 304) with the experiences of those who have succeeded in earning science degrees (N = 307). Participants were surveyed about their pipeline experiences based on theories that are commonly used to explain matriculation issues. The results of the study revealed that although both groups recognized the major role of race in their experiences, the primary factor distinguishing between students and professionals was their sense of Alignment with their respective community and their different experiences with subtle forms of racism (Microaggressions). African-American scientists were far more likely to report a weak sense of belonging to their community and were far more likely to report subtle encounters with racism. By contrast, African-American science students were more likely to feel comfortable with the science community and less likely to report subtle racist encounters. The findings of this study are indicative of the pervasive impact of racial bias and conflict as a gatekeeper in providing access to science careers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID CHOICES
AB This chapter explores issues that have influenced Black women in Canada and the Caribbean in their pursuit of advanced degrees and regular academic roles in Computer Science (CS) and related fields. The concern is with the low representation of Black women in such roles and the reasons why some women have chosen the field and others have fled from it. The issues are related to gender and race and have been gathered from the scientific literature on Computer Science Education. Black women in Canada and the Caribbean who are on paths towards and in regular academic roles in CS were surveyed about how these issues have influenced them and their peers for or against CS in general and more specifically advanced education in Computer Science, since these such choices for CS are a requirement for regular academic roles in CS. This work delivers insights into an understudied locale for an underrepresented group in a field critical to economic development in Canada and the Caribbean. Based on our findings, we make recommendations to increase the number of this underrepresented group.

AB There is a critical need to develop initiatives aimed at expanding and diversifying the healthcare workforce, beginning with medical education. This chapter addresses racial and gender disparities in academic medicine and biomedical research. Racial and ethnic minorities and women remain underrepresented in medicine, biomedical research, and healthcare leadership. These disparities are national issues and have far-reaching effects which translate into significant educational and healthcare-delivery disparities. Research has shown that health care professionals from underserved backgrounds are more likely than others to work in underserved areas which would address current shortages in health professionals for the medically underserved. The authors describe their theory for the existence and persistence of these disparities. They offer evidence of these disparities while concluding with current initiatives to address these disparities, calling for innovative approaches to training underrepresented minorities and women as physicians and biomedical research scientists.

Research shows that stereotypical beliefs are pervasive and exist in all professions, including higher education. Women academics, especially in the STEM fields, are still present in low numbers and often have to sacrifice marriage and family for their careers due to the overarching masculine organizational structure that forms the basis of most higher education institutions. This chapter will discuss the history of women in academia, gender equity in higher education, and the consequences of gender normative language on women in academia.

AB This chapter documents the experiences of the ongoing journey of an African American female physicist. They correspond to those in documented studies of other African Americans and females in both the specific field of physics as well as the broader area encompassing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). While there are some anomalies, when scaled with the norm of these groups, there is a thread of consistencies in the obstructions and difficulties that seem to be unique to mostly African Americans and on a smaller scale to White females. The intent of this writing is to shine a light on the status of affairs particularly in the scientific Ph.D. community, an area that many have felt was immune to the difficulties faced by African Americans on the lower end of society. It is evident that our society is neither "post-racial" nor "post-sexist", even on the higher intellectual turf.

ID MEDICAL-SCHOOL; GENDER; RESIDENCY
AB In New York City, from the 1990s to the present, covert racism is alive and well in the field of medicine and medical education. This racism largely manifested itself as inequitable treatment of illness. The most heavily impacted are African American and Caribbean American females and males. These inequities engendered results such as unwarranted criticism in residency education, forced changes of medical occupations and jobs, and false attributions of behavioral health issues. Combating these challenges requires fortified character armor, seeking percipient well positioned minorities, white and off-whites allies, and a willingness to maintain continued vigilance. With persistence and tenacity, success is possible in terms of protecting minorities both in the educational process, and subsequent medical career.

AB Protagonists of the 'philological turn' have claimed philology to be a self-reflective praxis. The history of modern philology however demonstrates that this can only be understood as a demand. All too often, philological conceptions went hand in glove with a deterministic anthropology. Whereas current research on the nexus between philology and racial thought focus on how biopolitical assumptions could be applied within philological disciplines, the idea of a 'hard' anthropological nucleus and a 'soft' textual culture referring to it needs to be revised. Because of their methodological potential and cultural strength, European philologies were scientific models up to the second half of the 19th century and relied on the same epistemic assumptions from which 'modern' raciological discourses were born. This comes mainly from the relation established since the 17th century between the variety of languages, scripts and textual cultures on the one hand, and rationality on the other. The arguments that stem from this discourse of a challenged universalism were amalgamated with genealogical thought in 19th century philology and an obsession with origins as the biblical narrative faded away. Thus, spiritual or cognitive forms, understood as determining factors in historical evolution, could then be linked to an assumed 'original' intellectual or anthropological potentiality. However, raciological conceptualizations have been far from being without alternative. My paper argues that if the return to philology aims to be more than a reaction to the normative loss of textual culture, then the epistemological struggle within the history of philology needs to be reflected in its relevance for any 'future' philology.

AB A critical race theory was used to analyse policies and strategies in place to enable the participation of New Zealand ethnic women of Latin-American, Middle Eastern, and African (MELAA) origin in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields (STEM) in education and industry. The aim was to find out what policy - and other - levers are available for better participation in the STEM fields by the ethnic women's population. The process involved an analysis of publicly available official documents on STEM strategies at national and regional levels. The main findings were that gender issues are expressed in a generic way, either across all ethnic groups, or across the four ethnic groups where the MELAA stands not clearly identifiable in the classifications. Recommendations include the need to develop policies and strategies that account for race and gender equity as part of an agenda to eliminate marginalization of this group.

AB The discussion promoted in this text is part of the inquiry of PhD in Education in progress since 2012 at Fluminense Federal University (Niteroi, Brazil). The above-mentioned doctoral research is dedicated to the study of educational trajectories of prestigious black professionals in Brazil. The main objective of this text is to bring up a reflection on the studies about the relation between prestigious college courses and race/skin color in Brazil carried out in the contemporaneousness. For this purpose, it is necessary to analyze the process of selection of the professional careers that demand the ownership of the bachelor's degree (higher education). This text is supported by studies about social stratification, such as Wright (1978), Goldthorpe (1987), Januzzi (2003) and Queiroz (2004). Bibliographical inquiry was the methodology elected for the development of the present text.

AB The engineering field, in particular, struggles to recruit and retain students, especially women of color. Thus, consideration of how academic environments, such as treatment by faculty and peers, interaction with faculty, and available resources for learning and tutoring, uniquely affect women of color is examined. Several theories, such as critical racial theory, intersectionality, and campus climate framework, highlight the importance of examining individual characteristics and details of the environmental context. This study used data from a sample of 850 women students in 120 U.S. engineering undergraduate programs from 31 four-year institutions. Black women engineering students experienced and perceived more differential treatment because of their race/ethnicity but interacted more with faculty than White women students. This study provides critical implications for policy and practice regarding how administrators and faculty members can design engineering programs to create better climate and offer resources for women of color students.

AB Human-wildlife conflict has historically been portrayed as a management problem where solutions lie in technical changes or financial incentives. However, recent research shows many conflicts stem from social, economic, and political drivers. We undertook qualitative data collection on livestock farms to determine whether relationships between farmers and their workers affected frequency of reported livestock depredation in Namibia. We found that the conflict was affected by social and economic inequalities embedded in the previous apartheid regime. Macro-and microlevel socioeconomic problems created an environment where livestock depredation was exacerbated by unmotivated farm workers. Poor treatment of workers by farmers resulted in vengeful behaviors, such as livestock theft and wildlife poaching. Successfully addressing this situation therefore requires recognition and understanding of its complexity, rather than reducing it to its most simplistic parts.

AB Surgery is a medical specialty that has a rich history of rigorous training, and the development of a young surgeon requires both individual study and external reinforcement to ensure competency. Although, women are entering medical school at increasing numbers, they only make up to 19% of American surgeons. Minority women represent an even smaller number. Recent studies document that minorities report challenges during surgical residency that may inhibit successful surgical training. These challenges are explored as they relate to limited mentoring and collegial isolation while training in trauma surgery.

AB Purpose: This study sought to examine whether perceived interpersonal racism in the form of racial micro aggressions was associated with preterm birth (PTB) and whether the presence of depressive symptoms and perceived stress modified the association.
   Methods: Data stem from a cohort of 1410 black women residing in Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, enrolled into the Life-course Influences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) study. The Daily Life Experiences of Racism and Bother (DLE-B) scale measured the frequency and perceived stressfulness of racial micro aggressions experienced during the past year. Severe past-week depressive symptomatology was measured by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) dichotomized at >= 23. Restricted cubic splines were used to model nonlinearity between perceived racism and PTB. We used the Perceived Stress Scale to assess general stress perceptions.
   Results: Stratified spline regression analysis demonstrated that among those with severe depressive symptoms, perceived racism was not associated with PTB. However, perceived racism was significantly associated with PTB among women with mild to moderate (CES-D score <= 22) depressive symptoms. Perceived racism was not associated with PTB among women with or without high amounts of perceived stress.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that racism, at least in the form of racial micro aggressions, may not further impact a group already at high risk for PTB (those with severe depressive symptoms), but may increase the risk of PTB for women at lower baseline risk.

DT Article
AB The Parisian quartier of Belleville is considered the ideal setting for roman noir. Post-1968 French neo-polar writers proffer a critical view of contemporary French society with its social inequality, racism, corporate and political corruption, unemployment and its consequences. This paper presents a transatlantic view of contemporary Belleville seen through the eyes of French author and journalist Serge Quadruppani, Canadian artist and author Blaise Giuliani, and American crime fiction writer Cara Black. How do these representations of Belleville differ from one side of the Atlantic to the other? From where do these differences stem? What is the relationship between fact and fiction in each of these portrayals? Does the authors' readership affect the way Belleville is depicted? In attempting to answer these questions, this article contributes to discussions about place and setting in the roman noir/neo-polar, contemporary Belleville, and its reputation in and outside of France.

AB Understanding why women are underrepresented in various Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields remains an important area of research. In the United States and in many industrialized nations around the world, STEM professions remain male dominated. Explanations for why women are not participating STEM professions are many and diverse. The Ecology Systems Theory (EST) presents a lens through which the causes for the continued underrepresentation of women in STEM fields may be examined. EST is widely accepted theoretical framework for exploring the influences that contribute to the development of an individual. The study presented in this chapter explored the familial, educational, economic, and social experiences of 125 female participants working in a STEM field. Findings suggest there are influences at specific levels in EST that can and do affect the educational and career aspirations of women in relationship to STEM fields.

AB Indigenous youth represent one of the most marginalized demographics in Canada. As such they must contend with many barriers to wellness that stem from oppression, including historical and ongoing colonization and racism. Developing effective health programming requires innovation and flexibility, especially important when programs take place in diverse Indigenous communities where local needs and cultural practices vary. This article reports the findings of an after-school program in 2014 that blended a participatory visual method of research with Indigenous knowledge, methodologies, and practices to provide sociocultural health programming for youth in a First Nation in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Engaging with youth to co-research wellbeing through the arts was conceptualized as both research and health promotion. Participatory arts methods created a safe space for youth to express their views of health and wellness issues while developing self-knowledge about their individual and cultural identities.

AB In this critical multisite case study we examined the concept of colorblind mentoring. Using Bonilla-Silva's Colorblind Racism Frames, we sought to understand White faculty members' perspectives on their mentoring of Students of Color. The findings revealed that White faculty members often engage with students from a "colorblind perspective." Their use of race-neutral, colorblind language (avoiding racial terms but implying them) allowed White faculty members to describe their students as academically inferior, less prepared, and less interested in pursuing research and graduate studies while potentially ignoring structural causes. Faculty perceptions of students may influence the way Students of Color perceive their academic abilities and potential to achieve success in STEM disciplines and in graduate education.

   speech; liberalism; market state; race
AB Press freedom and free speech have again become central questions in discussions of democracy and power. A whole range of events have called into question the role of the press in the democratic process in today's combined context of economic crisis and the free reign of market forces. From the publication of the racist cartoons in Denmark, to the Wikileaks witch hunt, to the Leveson inquiry in Britain, the rhetoric of press freedom is revealed as a universalizing concept that masks political and class interest - free expression is not treated universally, but is tied to questions of social, political and economic power. This article argues, however, that it is not the case that liberal democracy has latterly been corrupted or impaired. Instead, the significant limits of liberalism, highlighted by the above instances, stem from the historical conditions which gave rise to it; mass revolution and reaction in the 19th century resulted in constitutional democracies which established the principle of freedom, but not the fact. This article will suggest that from the outset, constitutional democracies were shaped by the class interests of an economic elite. There has been a historic entanglement of emancipation and de-emancipation in liberal thought, and the role of the press in this enterprise has been to use a racially charged definition of freedom and the notion of a threat to our freedoms' to scapegoat the Muslim population and to justify curbing their' freedoms.

AB In 1962, anthropologist Carleton Coon argued in The Origin of Races that some human races had evolved further than others. Among his most vocal critics were geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky and anthropologist Ashley Montagu, each of whom had known Coon for decades. I use this episode, and the long relationships between scientists that preceded it, to argue that scientific research on race was intertwined not only with political projects to conserve or reform race relations, but also with the relationships scientists shared as colleagues. Demarcation between science and pseudoscience, between legitimate research and scientific racism, involved emotional as well as intellectual labor.

AB This study deals with the problem of falling of so-called old paradigm, the paradigm of multiculturalism. Firstly, we turn our attention to the actual and, surprisingly enough, political rejection of multiculturalism. Recently, many European countries have faced various problems with their integration policies. Despite the large number of studies on the race, as well as a number of European and international documents and declarations against racism, a paradoxical phenomenon appeared: the concept of race was restored as a "scientific fact". Although the word race was not explicitly mentioned, the concept of ethnicity offered extensive strategic support for so-called "backward groups". Humanistic paradigm of legal equality has been replaced by the paradigm of ethnic or racial policies, i.e. policies of collective identity. As it turned out, these policies have failed. The goal of humanistic paradigm was to get rid of the word race's false scientific aura. Humanistic paradigm as a meta-paradigm has accepted the existence of biological differences among individuals and human populations, but there was no need to take them into account when defending its legitimacy or promoting its ideal. We assert that these problems stem from useless attempts at defending "scientifically" human equality which, however, is not based on scientific evidence, but rather on the ideal of universal equality built up on pillars such as the Christian heritage, western law, and values represented by the human beings' capability of suffering.

AB Understanding bone health is least invasively and most effectively done through studying skeletal remains that reflect the living populations who will benefit from the knowledge produced through research. Donated body collections that accurately represent modern populations are needed for osteological insights to be applied to clinical practices. However, even though the US is growing increasingly diverse, donated body collections still suffer from a lack of ethnic diversity. Most individuals who donate their whole-bodies after death are European-American. Reasons for a lack of ethnic diversity stem from past injustices and present religious norms. Increasing body donation among minorities in the US and abroad may be difficult.

AB Objective: Although both Black and White individuals report racial discrimination, self-report measures of exposure to racial discrimination that can be used across races/ethnicities are rare. The primary aim of our study was to determine if the Schedule of Racist Events (SRE), which was designed for use in Black samples, should also be used in White samples, and if so, what modifications to the scale are necessary.
   Methods: In a sample of 302 adults, approximately equally divided by race, we investigated whether item endorsement differed between Black and White respondents.
   Results: Results of confirmatory factor analysis and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis suggest that changing the item stem (from 'because you are Black' to 'because of your race/ethnicity') and removing four items that show differential item functioning and/or do not load on the first factor, results in a psychometrically sound scale with no evidence of measurement bias.
   Conclusion: Researchers interested in measuring racial discrimination in samples that include both Black and White respondents may consider using this version of the SRE. Future studies should investigate other forms of validity in Black and White samples.

The sample includes surveys from 1024 high school-aged students and interviews from 53 students. Logistic analysis showed that higher science aspirations significantly predicted perceived support for girls and women in science. Analysis of interviews showed themes of microaggressions, responses to microaggressions, and gender- and race-based support. Findings suggest participants vary in perceptions of barriers, yet are generally optimistic about overcoming such obstacles.

ID RACE
AB A growing conundrum facing Mexico is the underdevelopment of communities inhabited by Black nationals. The political consequences of marginalization, evident in present-day conditions of poverty, stem from the historical and linguistic negation of the African presence in Mexico and its relevance in the country's overall social and political evolution. In national politics, the problem has seldom been engaged because the disparity in wealth distribution is considered a result of the exclusion of the Indian. When Blacks are considered, there is a popular refocusing on Latin American Afro-descendants that "folklorizes" the "other" under a fictitious celebratory veil of multiculturalism. This article addresses the socioeconomic dynamics in Black Mexican communities, focusing attention on the burgeoning social movement in the Costa Chica that is addressing issues of invisibility and recognition of el Pueblo Negro in Mexico. By detailing a Diasporan account of Black identity, the authors argue that los Negros can strategically employ a vindication of Blackness in Mexico in their fight for social justice, ultimately uniting citizens in the quest.

TI 'Cultural Criminology, Governmentality and the Liquidity of the Failing
   State: The View from Ireland' for <i>Critical Criminology</i>
SO CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A number of incidents and community movements in the post-economic growth era have come to shape understandings of the Republic of Ireland's marginalised groupings. These groups exist in both urban streetscapes and rural communities; all have come to represent a new culture of transgressive resistance in a state that has never completely dealt with issues of political legitimacy or extensive poverty, creating a deviant form of 'liquid modernity' which provides the space for such groupings to exist. The article demonstrates that the prevailing ideology in contemporary, post-downturn Ireland have created the conditions for incidents of 'cultural criminology' that at times erupt into episodes of counter hegemonic governmentality. The article further argues that these groups which have emerged may represent the type of transgressive Foucaultian governmentality envisaged by Kevin Stenson, while they are indicative of subcultures of discontent and nascent racism which belie the contented findings of various affluence and contentment surveys conducted during the years of rapid growth. The paper develops this theme of counter-hegemonic 'governmentality', or the regional attempts to challenge authorities by local groups of transgressors. The paper finally argues that, in many ways, the emergence of a culture of criminality in the Irish case, and media depictions of the same, can be said to stem from the corruption of that country's elites as much as from any agenda for resistance from its beleaguered subcultures.

AB Nursing values include diversity and a commitment to the elimination of health disparities. However, nursing comprises predominantly white, female nurses. The authors explore structural and interpersonal sources of disparities experienced by black persons, including white privilege. Here, the authors advocate for a continuation of the racism conversation, specifically among white nurses. Racial disadvantages stem from structural inequalities from daily slights, and usually unintended subtle racism toward black people on the part of white people, including white nurses. By raising consciousness on how we propagate subtle racism, nursing can progress faster in eliminating health disparities. Topics include postracialism, colorblindness, institutional racism, white privilege, health disparities, clinical encounters, subtle racism, and racial microaggressions. Suggestions for open dialogue, historical awareness, education, research, and practice are highlighted. Difficulties involved in confronting racism and white privilege are explored.

AB This article explores the possibility that dominant-group members will attempt to appease subordinate groups to protect the hierarchy. In four studies, we find that (a) prohierarchy Whites perceive more intergroup threat when they believe ethnic minorities hold Whites in low regard, (b) prohierarchy Whites respond to ethnic minorities' low regard for Whites by increasing their support for redistributive policies (e.g., affirmative action), (c) the increase in support only occurs when prohierarchy Whites perceive the hierarchy to be unstable, and (d) prohierarchy Whites perceive the hierarchy to be more stable if they believe Whites support redistributive policies. These results suggest that prohierarchy dominant-group members' support for redistributive policies can stem from a concern about maintaining the hierarchical status quo, and provides evidence that support for redistributive policies can be a hierarchy-enhancing strategy.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to explore doctoral students' experiences engaging in conversations about the role of race and racism in education during their programs. We conducted focus groups with graduate students in a School of Education at a predominantly White institution in the South. Our findings support the notion that creating space for doctoral students to engage in "race talk" (Pollock, M., 2004, Colormute: Race talk dilemmas in an American high school. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press) during their courses is essential for developing racial literacy, or the ability to critically analyze racial/racist ideologies, norms, and patterns embedded in educational policies and practices. We assert that our participants' varied experiences engaging in race talk (i.e., the relative presence of conversations in certain programs and their limited presence in others) may stem from a variety of factors including disciplinary cultures and faculty values and expectations, as well as professional standards advanced by accrediting bodies and organizations. In light of our findings, we conclude that critical conversations about race should be intentionally integrated into doctoral coursework in education. We suggest that colleges/schools of education should increase their efforts to produce racially literate professionals capable of problematizing the constructions of race and racist practices in educational settings.

AB The development of affordable housing often involves a contentious siting process. Proposed housing developments frequently trigger concern among neighbors and community groups about potential negative impacts on neighborhood quality of life and property values. Advocates, developers, and researchers have long suspected that these concerns stem in part from racial or class prejudice. Yet, to date, empirical evidence supporting these assumptions is lacking. This study seeks to examine roles that perceptions of race and class play in shaping opinions that underlie public opposition to affordable housing. This study applies a public opinion survey to determine the extent to which stereotypes and perceptions of the poor and minorities relate to attitudes toward affordable housing. The results demonstrate that such perceptions are particularly strong determinants of negative attitudes about affordable housing. These findings provide advocates, planners, developers, and researchers with a more accurate portrayal of affordable housing opposition, thereby allowing the response to be shaped in a more appropriate manner.

AB This examination is a case study analysis of the Mail & Guardian's news coverage surrounding the ongoing trial of members of the separatist group, die Boeremag. The 22 defendants stand accused of treason and 41 other criminal charges for the 2002 bombings of Soweto and conspiring to establish an independent Boer state. Utilizing a race critical lens, this analysis looks at these news representations of Afrikaner nationalists to glean insight into how law, race and racism can imbricate public understandings crime, specifically, in this case, domestic terrorism. It draws attention to the ways in which this fundamentalist group emerges as a repugnant Other and interrogates their roles within the "imagined'' postapartheid South African community, the newspaper's target audience. After explicating these dynamics, the paper concludes with a discussion of how this case study relates to practical dilemmas that stem from the utopian ideologies of reconciliation and nonracialism.

AB The present study examined the causal role of amount of Black ancestry in targets' perceived fit with Black prototypes and perceivers' categorization of biracial targets. Greater Black ancestry increased the likelihood that perceivers categorized biracial targets as Black and perceived targets as fitting Black prototypes (e.g., experiencing racial discrimination, possessing stereotypic traits). These results persisted, controlling for perceptions of phenotype that stem from ancestry information. Perceivers' beliefs about how society would categorize the biracial targets predicted perceptions of discrimination, whereas perceivers' beliefs about the targets' self-categorization predicted trait perceptions. The results of this study support the Black ancestry prototype model of affirmative action, which reveals the downstream consequences of Black ancestry for the distribution of minority resources (e.g., affirmative action) to biracial targets.

TI GOBINEAU, RACISM, AND LEGITIMISM: A ROYALIST HERETIC IN
   NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE
SO MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The work of Arthur de Gobineau has presented scholars with a number of interpretive problems concerning his status as a race theorist, his place in the history of racial thought, and the influence of his work on subsequent thinkers. This essay addresses the particularly vexing issue of the origins of Gobineau's racism from the perspective of his affiliation with French royalists in the 1840s and challenges the existing scholarship on the derivation of L'Essai sur l'inegalite des races humaines by placing the Essai in the context of his international experience as a member of the French diplomatic corps. Although disillusioned with legitimist politics during the July Monarchy, Gobineau never abandoned his youthful ideological priorities. Front the perspective of Ins royalist past, the Essai appears as part of an extended rumination on the decadence of the French aristocracy and its failure to stem the tide of revolution and bureaucratic centralization. As such, Gobineau's racism can best be understood as a royalist heresy rather than a continuation of his aristocratic elitism or a clean break with his earlier preoccupations.

AB Madureira's (Integr Psych Behav, 42(23), 2007) article on the cultural barriers of homophobia articulates the need for an integrative approach to the study of homophobia and sexism. This comment focuses on critically examining the similarities and differences between homophobia and sexism. Sexism and homophobia are related concepts - both likely stem from a patriarchic social structure with specific expectations for the proper roles of men and women-but they are also distinct in important ways. The potential benefits of integrated research on racism and homophobia are also discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES

DE institutional racism; British education; agency; educational visions;

AB This article explores the recent increase in permanent exclusions of Black boys in the British educational system. Parents and educators have long been concerned about the education or "miseducation" of Black children. These concerns are reflected in the deep sense of urgency in Black communities about the need for an overall strategy to stem the tide of exclusions of Black boys. The authors argue that the continuing denial of race and racism in British educational policy is reflected in the intransigence of many schools to consider the differential positioning of Black boys in the wider society and its effect on their educational experiences and opportunities. This article draws on a research study in which Black boys voice their experiences of what it means to be young, Black, and male in Britain in 2004 and also seeks to move beyond critiques to embrace alternative visions of schooling to re-engage young people and bring about successful futures.

   skin colour and ancestry
SO ETHNICITY & HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE identity; racism; agency; structure; representation; reaction
ID MINORITY PEOPLE; HEALTH; IDENTITY; WHITES; RACE
AB Objectives. The definitions of ethnic status currently employed in, particularly, epidemiological research, tend to focus on skin colour or on perceived historical or ancestral links with certain geographical locations. Neither of these classificatory systems stem from any widely supported theoretical standpoint and their usefulness in terms of explaining any ethnic variation is therefore questionable. In order to enable more informative exploration of ethnicity and its relationship with health and other indicators, a clearer understanding of the processes involved in ethnic identification is required. This paper sets out to explore underlying dimensions which could constitute an ethnic identity across different ethnic groups in England.
   Design. Principal components factor analyses on the different ethnic groups included in the Ethnic Minority Psychiatric Illness Rates in the Community study: Bangladeshi, Caribbean, Indian, Irish and Pakistani people and a 'white majority' group. Results. In each ethnically specific model, three dimensions of ethnic identity were determined, related to multiculturalism, or the sustenance of ethnic difference, racialisation and community participation. In the ethnic minority group models the 'multiculturalism' dimension formed two factors: one related to the presentation of oneself as a member of a particular ethnic group and one exploring attitudes towards cultural assimilation. The findings suggested that the processes of ethnic identification are similar across the different ethnic (minority and majority) groups explored, but that there may be important differences within any particular group.
   Conclusion. The recognition of these dimensions of ethnic affiliation provide us with an opportunity to improve our indicators of ethnic status. Each of these dimensions would appear to be important to the lives of people from different ethnic groups in England. These findings also highlight the important role that external attitudes play in the understanding of what it means to be a member of any ethnic group. This aspect of ethnic affiliation has been ignored by current definitions of ethnicity and this imbalance should be redressed.

AB It has been suggested that well-documented differences in African and African-Caribbean people's contact with mental health services may stem from a spiral of disaffection, reluctance to seek help and re-admission to hospital in times of crisis. In 1997, an African and Caribbean mental health resource centre was established in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea with the aim of ensuring that the needs of this group were better met. As part of an evaluation of the study, interviews were carried out with 26 clients of the resource centre. This article presents their perceptions of the service provided and its impact on their lives. The clients' accounts indicate that the resource centre was providing a valued service that was successful in reducing their sense of social isolation, enabling them to address issues of identity and self-worth associated with racism and working with other service providers to better meet their needs.

As predicted, participants with a "progressive" attitude toward women's rights and roles (J. T. Spence, R. L. Helmreich, & J. Stapp, 1973) made fewer within-group recall errors for female targets than for male targets, indicating greater individuation of the female targets, whereas participants with a "traditional" attitude made fewer errors for male targets. The findings of a 5th study suggested that progressive participants were motivated to individuate women by their belief that it is important to improve the status of women and other groups low in power and by their identification with women and feminism. Traditional participants' greater individuation of men was believed to stem from their perception of men's higher status las confirmed by pretests) and their acceptance of the status quo.

AB This article provides the theoretical resources to resolve a number of conundrums in the work of William Julius Wilson and John Ogbu. Contrary to what Wilson's and Ogbu's work sometimes imply, inner-city blacks are not enmeshed in a "culture of poverty," but rather are generally committed to mainstream values and their normative expectations. Activities that deviate from these values derive from the cognitive expectations inner-city blacks have formed in the face of their restricted legitimate opportunity structures. These expectations, which suggest that educational and occupational success are improbable for inner-city residents, are accurate. If their opportunities were to improve, their cognitive expectations would change and most would be committed to taking advantage of these new opportunities. The differences that separate the inner-city poor from whites center on cultural symbols, which help constitute their identity, sometimes in opposition to the white majority. Most deficiencies in performance among blacks stem not from these cultural attributes, but from the way they are processed in white-dominated organizations. Given a majority commitment to equal opportunity and a majority belief that blacks actually have equal opportunity, many conclude from their performance that blacks are in some sense inferior. This "new racism " overdetermines the performance of blacks.
