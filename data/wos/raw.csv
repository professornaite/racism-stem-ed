Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read assimilate) underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating racially hostile work and educational spaces. I argue that, without a critical examination of the structural racism omnipresent in the STEM, progress in racially diversifying STEM will continue at a snail's pace.","[McGee, Ebony Omotola] Vanderbilt Univ, Divers & STEM Educ, Peabody Coll, PMB 230 GPC 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"McGee, EO (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Divers & STEM Educ, Peabody Coll, PMB 230 GPC 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",ebony.mcgee@vanderbilt.edu,"McGee, Ebony Omotola/F-1747-2016",,,,,,116,161,224,23,72,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0013-189X,1935-102X,,EDUC RESEARCHER,Educ.

In this article, we employ phenomenological analysis to examine how 54 Black engineering and computing students experience racism marketed as impostor syndrome (syndrome meaning in their heads). Results show that 51 of our study participants understood their experiences as both impostorism and racism, as some realized that racism created the conditions for being racially positioned as an impostor.

In this paper, we investigate barriers and supports to Black women's success in STEM, using longitudinal interview data with seven Black women who were enrolled at community colleges and stated an interest in majoring in STEM at 4-year institutions. Results Our findings highlight a contrast between community colleges and universities. At community colleges, Black women were able to form supportive relationships with professors and peers, downplayed the potential of racism and sexism to derail their STEM ambitions, and saw little to no impact of bias on their educational experiences. Those students who transferred characterized university climates very differently, as they struggled to form supportive relationships and experienced racism and sexism from professors and peers. Conclusions We conclude using Patricia Hill Collins' Domains of Power framework to categorize students' experiences, then end with recommendations for change that will result in less alienating experiences for Black women, among other minoritized students.","[Allen, DeeDee] Wake Tech Community Coll, Dept Phys Sci, Raleigh, NC 27616 USA; [Dancy, Melissa] Western Michigan Univ, Evaluat Ctr, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Stearns, Elizabeth; Mickelson, Roslyn; Bottia, Martha] UNC Charlotte, Dept Sociol, Charlotte, NC USA",Western Michigan University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Allen, D (corresponding author), Wake Tech Community Coll, Dept Phys Sci, Raleigh, NC 27616 USA.",daallen@waketech.edu,,"Allen, DeeDee/0000-0001-8459-2397",National Science Foundation [NSF-DRL 1420363],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant #NSF-DRL 1420363.

They are also much less likely to recognise the existence of white privilege in Australia. Discourse analysis of these participants' open-ended survey responses reveals their attitudes stem from a belief that their white national identity, and the privilege and ownership that accompanies this, is under threat. They view this 'threat' as a form of racism they are victims of.

The traditional stress and coping model holds that racism constitutes a source of aversive experiences that, when perceived by the individual, eventually lead to poor health outcomes. Current evidence points to additional psychophysiological pathways linking facets of racist environments with physiological reactions that contribute to disease. The alternative pathways emphasize prenatal experiences, subcortical emotional neural circuits, conscious and preconscious emotion regulation, perseverative cognitions, and negative affective states stemming from racist cognitive schemata. Recognition of these pathways challenges change agents to use an array of cognitive and self-controlling interventions in mitigating racism's impact. Additionally, it charges policy makers to develop strategies that eliminate deep-seated structural aspects of racism in society.","[Harrell, Camara Jules P.; Nelson, Travette McNair; Shearon, Sheronda; Thompson, Adrian; Green, Steven] Howard Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Burford, Tanisha I.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Cardiovasc Behav Med Res Training Program, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Cage, Brandi N.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Lab Brain Imaging & Behav, Madison, WI USA",Howard University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Harrell, CJP (corresponding author), Howard Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",jharrell@howard.edu,,,,,,,92,167,227,1,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-058X,1742-0598,,DU BOIS REV,Du Bois Rev.,SPR,2011,8,1,,,SI,,143,157,,10.1017/S1742058X11000178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742058X11000178,,,15,Ethnic Studies; Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Ethnic Studies; Sociology,051ZD,22518195,Green Accepted,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000312166600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Racial disadvantages stem from structural inequalities from daily slights, and usually unintended subtle racism toward black people on the part of white people, including white nurses. By raising consciousness on how we propagate subtle racism, nursing can progress faster in eliminating health disparities. Topics include postracialism, colorblindness, institutional racism, white privilege, health disparities, clinical encounters, subtle racism, and racial microaggressions.

Drawing on data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 30 school attendees from diverse backgrounds aged 14-22 years, conducted from December 2011 to January 2012 in Victoria, Australia, we critically examined their understandings of and experiences with racism. Data demonstrate the ambiguity of racism, while confirming that Australian youth from various racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds consistently conceptualise, explain, and classify racism, whilst minimising some forms of racism, including racist humour. Participants described racism through three primary domains: (a) Group versus Individual: racism stems from perceived differences, with individuals stereotyped as belonging to larger groups; (b) Actions versus Beliefs: individuals are classified as racist or non-racist according to their actions and beliefs; and (c) Exceptions, Exclusions and Minimisation: racism is frequently excused and minimised. The present research highlights the need for additional exploration of the nuances of racism in Australia from lay perspectives and provides clear evidence of the need to address racism in Australian society. Further developing the evidence base to understand the lived experience of racism in Australia could inform and support the design and evaluation of anti-racism and pro-diversity initiatives. Moreover, we hope that the present data can be drawn upon to enlighten the development of instruments to more accurately measure racist attitudes in Australian youth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It illustrates the complexity and inter-disciplinarity of the racial phenomenon by blending child-like and adult-like perspectives and, as such, it is written half as a fable and half as an academic article. It puts forward a number of arguments. First, the piece suggests that five key dimensions of racism exist-namely, the historical, the philosophical, the scientific, the legal and the economic-and that they are regularly used to justify and rationalise something (racial prejudice) that is often irrational. Second, the article highlights the 'banality' of racism-an attitude that stems from mankind's diffidence towards diversity, exploits such fear and encourages forms of passivity that, as Hannah Arendt noted, are the best way of 'banalising' evil and making it appear tolerable. The fanciful classifications of 'races'-such as those articulated in South Africa's apartheid, where poor Chinese were regarded as 'yellows' while wealthy Japanese were classified as 'honorary whites'-are cases in point. Third, the piece argues that racial discrimination is often unrecognised, internalised and unquestioned by society: since racial attitudes are learnt in childhood and become part of our cultural baggage, they are extremely difficult to identify and eradicate. Finally, the article suggests that racism is not only 'banal' but also highly convenient: racists do not need to know the individual, they just need to know the characteristics of the group to which that individual is thought to belong. The piece concludes in favour of a neglected right for children: the right to be left free from racism.","[Salton, Herman T.] Univ Wales, Dept Int Polit, Room 3 25,Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth SY23 3FE, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Salton, HT (corresponding author), Univ Wales, Dept Int Polit, Room 3 25,Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth SY23 3FE, Dyfed, Wales.",hes3@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,CANADIAN CENTER SCIENCE & EDUCATION,TORONTO,"1120 FINCH AVE W, STE 701-309, TORONTO, ON M3J 3H7, CANADA",1913-9047,1913-9055,,J POLIT LAW,J.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 42 undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees, the authors explore the nuances in racial perspectives as they highlight three contemporary student discourses of racism: the naive; the bystander; and the victim. Implications for policy and practice are suggested.","[Wong, Billy; Elmorally, Reham; Copsey-Blake, Meggie; Highwood, Ellie; Singarayer, Joy] Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Wong, B (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Reading RG1 5EX, Berks, England.",b.wong@reading.ac.uk,"Wong, Billy/X-1769-2019","Wong, Billy/0000-0002-7310-6418",University of Reading,University of Reading,This work was supported by the University of Reading.,,56,20,29,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-764X,1469-3577,,CAMB J EDUC,Camb.

However, there has been less attention on how white women, who experience sexism due to their gender but are privileged due to their race, simultaneously contribute to and play a role in dismantling systemic racism. In this study, I used constructivist grounded theory to explore the process through which white women in STEM commit to racial justice both within and outside of their disciplines. Interviews with 36 white women in STEM across a range of disciplines helped build an emergent model that illustrated how participants advanced through three stages to move toward actionable anti-racist commitment. However, many participants struggled to connect STEM with their anti-racist practice, as many STEM disciplines lacked anti-racism curriculum and/or the ability to practice anti-racism within STEM. This model helps illustrate the complex process in which white women in STEM become committed to racial justice. Within STEM specifically, this research has direct implications for the importance of adding social contexts and anti-racist material directly into STEM curricula to foster anti-racist practices for future STEM professionals.","[Forsythe, Desiree] Chapman Univ, Biol Sci, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Forsythe, D (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Biol Sci, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",desireelforsythe@gmail.com,,"Forsythe, Desiree/0000-0001-5582-4427",,,,,51,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-1546,1538-4640,,J HIGH EDUC-UK,J.

This article situates the social determinants of health of PCI and their health outcomes as stemming from settler colonialism and resultant structural racism by exploring how Palestinians came to be a racialized minority in their homeland.

Biases are influenced by background, cultural environment and experiences and we may not be aware of these views and opinions, or of their full impact and implications. This article opposes this point of view by arguing that bias is not unconscious but is (un) conscious and linked to Charles Mills' 'Racial Contract' and its 'epistemologies of ignorance'. These epistemologies emerge from what the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU) calls 'our background, cultural environment and personal experience'. Asserting that racism stems from 'unconscious bias' diminishes white supremacy and maintains white innocence as a 'will to forget' institutional racism. In equality and diversity training 'unconscious bias' has become a performative act to move beyond racism through training to participate in a constructed 'post-racial' reality. The article argues that through decolonizing 'unconscious bias', 'white fragility' and 'self-forgiveness' we can begin to see hidden institutional whiteliness at the base of (un) conscious bias.","[Tate, Shirley Anne; Page, Damien] Leeds Beckett Univ, Carnegie Sch Educ, Headingley Campus, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Tate, SA (corresponding author), Leeds Beckett Univ, Carnegie Sch Educ, Headingley Campus, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",s.a.tate@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,81,128,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1744-9642,1744-9650,,ETHICS EDUC,Ethics Educ.,,2018,13,1,,,SI,,141,155,,10.1080/17449642.2018.1428718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17449642.2018.1428718,,,15,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,FY5YP,,Green Accepted,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000426915100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

As staying at home is not a choice for these women, the suppression of the right to life reflects how the necropolitics against Black Brazilians operates. In Brazil, the naturalization of this form of violence finds great support in a mixture of affection and inequality relationships, in a context in which domestic workers, specifically housemaids, figure as the memory of Black mothers, that is, the enslaved women of the colonial period, coming from the African diaspora.

This gap in the literature stems from indirect conceptualizations and a lack of quantitative measurement of adolescents' acts to oppose racism. Correspondingly, this study presents the validation of a measure of youth anti-racism action. Study 1 describes the youth participatory approach used in the development of the Anti-Racism Action Scale and presents the results from an exploratory factor analysis that examined the measure's initial factor structure and reliability. The factor structure of the 22-item measure was explored with a diverse sample of adolescents (Mage=16.00, SD=1.18; 61.7% girls, Black/African American [29.3%], Asian/South Asian [21.1%], White/European American [24.4%], Arab/Middle-Eastern [17.5%], Latino/Hispanic [4.5%], and Multiracial [3.3%]) enrolled in a race dialogue program (n=249). The results indicated the measure consisted of three subscales: Interpersonal Action, Communal Action, and Political Change Action. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with an independent, nationally representative sample of youth (n=384) from diverse backgrounds (Mage=17.00, SD=1.29, 51.0% girls, White/European American [26.1%], Black/African American [25.6%], Latino/Hispanic [19.3%], Asian/Pacific Islander [13.6%], Multiracial [9.9%], Native American [5.2%] and other [0.3%]). The results confirmed a three-factor model that resulted in a 16-item measure. Furthermore, tests of convergent validity tests were pursued between the Anti-Racism Action Scale and the Critical Consciousness Scale, a widely used measure of youths' awareness of the structural causes of various forms of oppression, sense of sociopolitical agency, and social action. This study suggests that youth engagement in anti-racism is multidimensional and that notion of adolescent social action are more diverse than represented in the literature.","[Aldana, Adriana; Richards-Schuster, Katie] Calif State Univ, Dept Social Work, Dominguez Hill,1000 E Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA; [Banales, Josefina] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Richards-Schuster, Katie] Univ Michigan, Sch Social Work, 1080 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Aldana, A (corresponding author), Calif State Univ, Dept Social Work, Dominguez Hill,1000 E Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",aaldana@csudh.edu; jbanales@umich.edu; kers@umich.edu,"Aldana, Adriana/V-4001-2019","Aldana, Adriana/0000-0002-5218-6228",,,,,64,83,98,0,20,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-8346,2363-8354,,ADOLESC RES REV,Adolesc.

In Marxist parlance, racialisation is the ideological process through which the state racialised a section of the population (ethnic minorities) for political purposes. The centrality of the state in racialisation discourse has inhibited the class basis that underpins racialisation. This article articulates the class analysis of racialisation, positing that racialisation stems from racism ideology that the Western ruling class utilised to divide the people along the ethnic line as a means of preserving and maintaining ruling class influence and prestige in society and protecting the capitalist system from being challenged by the unity of the people along the class line. Racialisation is utilised to reproduce racism, using media, laws, regulations and institutional practices to entrench division and disunity in society and preserve their control system under capitalism. In discussing the future of racism, this article critiques the current anti-racism campaign/movement founded and rooted in race discourse and race consciousness and argues that a shift from race consciousness to racialised consciousness is pivotal towards deconstruction and eradicating all vestiges of racism in the global society. The article concludes that racialised consciousness would act as a political unifier in anti-racism campaigns and connects the struggles of Black working and middle class with that of the White working and middle class in terms of collaboration and solidarity, to collectively challenge the capitalist system that is responsible for oppression, inequality and racism on class lines.","[Ogunrotifa, Ayodeji Bayo] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham, England; [Ogunrotifa, Ayodeji Bayo] Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Ogunrotifa, AB (corresponding author), Univ London, Royal Holloway, Egham TW20 0EX, England.",Ayodeji.Ogunrotifa.2008@live.rhul.ac.uk,"Ogunrotifa, Ayodeji Bayo/IRZ-4841-2023","Ogunrotifa, Ayodeji Bayo/0000-0002-3728-1235",,,,,68,3,3,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0309-8168,2041-0980,,CAP CL,Cap.

Methods: Data stem from a cohort of 1410 black women residing in Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, enrolled into the Life-course Influences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) study. The Daily Life Experiences of Racism and Bother (DLE-B) scale measured the frequency and perceived stressfulness of racial micro aggressions experienced during the past year. Severe past-week depressive symptomatology was measured by the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) dichotomized at >= 23. Restricted cubic splines were used to model nonlinearity between perceived racism and PTB. We used the Perceived Stress Scale to assess general stress perceptions. Results: Stratified spline regression analysis demonstrated that among those with severe depressive symptoms, perceived racism was not associated with PTB. However, perceived racism was significantly associated with PTB among women with mild to moderate (CES-D score <= 22) depressive symptoms. Perceived racism was not associated with PTB among women with or without high amounts of perceived stress. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that racism, at least in the form of racial micro aggressions, may not further impact a group already at high risk for PTB (those with severe depressive symptoms), but may increase the risk of PTB for women at lower baseline risk.

Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being `non-Indian' with negative affiliation, or worse `unwanted Indians', but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.","[Haokip, Thongkholal] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Law & Governance, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Haokip, T (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Law & Governance, New Delhi 110067, India.",th.robert@yahoo.co.in,"Haokip, Thongkholal/Q-3708-2017","Haokip, Thongkholal/0000-0001-5936-7403",,,,,46,39,40,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1369,1469-2953,,ASIAN ETHN,Asian Ethn.,,2021,22,2,,,SI,,353,373,,10.1080/14631369.2020.1763161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14631369.2020.1763161,,,21,Ethnic Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Ethnic Studies,RZ1BU,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000648334500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a field, we must examine the process of producing and publishing the body of evidence that has codified harmful policies and practices.

The current study tested whether short-and long-term trajectories of depressive symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic differed between REMD adolescents who did and did not endorse exposure to COVID-19-era-related racism (i.e., racism stemming from conditions created or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic). Methods: A community sample of 100 REMD adolescents enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study of mental health was assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 51% girls, mean age = 16, standard deviation = 2.7, and identified as Latinx/Hispanic (48%), Multiethnic (34%), Asian American (12%), and Black (6%). Results: REMD adolescents' depressive symptoms were elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, and increases were more pronounced over time for those who endorsed exposure to COVID-19-era-related racism. In general, Asian American participants endorsed racism experiences at the highest rates compared to others, including being called names (42%), people acting suspicious around them (33%), and being verbally threatened (17%). Addi-tionally, more than half of Black and Asian American participants reported worry about experi-encing racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic, even if they had not experienced it to date. Discussion: REMD adolescents are at increased risk for depressive symptoms related to converging stressors stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic-related racism, which has the potential to widen racial/ethnic mental health disparities faced by the REMD youth.

The motivation to identify cognitive universals stems from the close relationship between biology and human cognition and from the theoretical architecture presupposed by the information-processing model. In this article, we argue that the underlying theoretical assumption of universality also stems from epistemological and methodological assumptions that laws of cognition can be effectively developed only by controlling for variables deemed to be outside the scope of internal cognition. These assumptions have resulted in the development of a science of human cognition based on the performance and behavior of a White, English-speaking, normatively invisible, racially color-evasive, socially dominant (WEIRD) class. In this article, we identify how scientific racism has influenced the study of cognition and offer perspective on how researchers may reconsider many of the premises that undergird our approach.","[Thomas, Ayanna K.] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [de Royston, Maxine McKinney] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Curriculum & Instruction, Madison, WI USA; [Powell, Shameka] Tufts Univ, Dept Educ, Medford, MA USA",Tufts University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Tufts University,"Thomas, AK (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",ayanna.thomas@tufts.edu,,,,,,,45,8,9,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0963-7214,1467-8721,,CURR DIR PSYCHOL SCI,Curr.

The paper draws on humour studies and critical race theory to illustrate signs of humour as defence. Research on humour has popularly explored the ambiguities and qualities of humour and, in particular, joke telling through its use as a foil to stem racial ills is less well understood. Where previous work has focused on explicit joke telling/banter in sport, this paper examines how techniques of humour are used in everyday racialised experiences. The use of techniques of humour enables feelings of subordination, and humiliation to be transposed into forms of resistance, while its physiological and psychological benefits can lead to inter-racial relief and catharsis. The paper concludes that techniques of humour remain underexplored as important tools of resistance to everyday racism.","[Hylton, Kevin] Leeds Beckett Univ, 202 Cavendish Hall, Leeds LS6 3QU, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Hylton, K (corresponding author), Leeds Beckett Univ, 202 Cavendish Hall, Leeds LS6 3QU, W Yorkshire, England.",k.hylton@leedsbeckett.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,20,22,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1468-7968,1741-2706,,ETHNICITIES,Ethnicities,JUN,2018,18,3,,,,,327,343,,10.1177/1468796817743998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468796817743998,,,17,Ethnic Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Ethnic Studies,GF6FU,,Green Accepted,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000432063300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores an underexamined issue in relation to color-blind ideology in STEM education. Specifically, it examines how a sample of college science faculty members use color-blind framings to make sense of the underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students in their fields. Interviews were conducted with 42 professors (majority tenured/ tenure-track, white, male, and continuing generation to college) in a College of Sciences at a research-intensive, historically white institution in the United States. Thematic analysis showed that while many faculty members implicated systemic racism in their sense making about the underrepresentation of racially minoritized students in STEM, the majority used colorblind frames (abstract liberalism, cultural racism, and minimization of racism) by focusing on individual behaviors and choices, cultural deficits, under-preparation, and poverty. Consistent with the research on color-blind ideology, professors were able to explain racial phenomena without implicating race/racism, which allowed them to absolve themselves from responsibility in addressing racial inequality issues in higher education. Faculty members who made sense of underrepresentation through systemic racism framings tended to recognize that they had a role to play in ameliorating these issues for students of color. These findings have implications for future research and professional development efforts.","[Russo-Tait, Tatiane] Univ Texas Austin, STEM Educ, 1912 Speedway Stop D5700, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Russo-Tait, T (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, STEM Educ, 1912 Speedway Stop D5700, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",tatiane@utexas.edu,,"Russo-Tait, Tatiane/0000-0002-2606-2061",University of Texas at Austin's Graduate School Continuing Fellowship; College of Education Dean's Scholars Fellowship,University of Texas at Austin's Graduate School Continuing Fellowship; College of Education Dean's Scholars Fellowship,This study was made possible by The University of Texas at Austin's Graduate School Continuing Fellowship and College of Education Dean's Scholars Fellowship,,109,11,15,3,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4308,1098-2736,,J RES SCI TEACH,J.

Given the ongoing pandemic and the wave of protests in response to a series of police brutalities and systemic racism, URM students were thrown into uncharted territory. We reached out to a group of Black and Latino students who were already engaged in STEM. We began surveys and interviews by asking participants how they were and how their family and communities were doing. Next, participants answered questions about academic progress, challenges, and what support would be helpful. Our framework was based on a mixed-methods approach that draws on the work of Michael Patton (Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice, 2014) and Veronica Thomas (American Journal of Evaluation, 2016, 38 (1), 7-28). Qualitative data from interviews were collected to capture perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of the study participants. Survey data were collected to reach as many students as possible and to provide numerical self-assessments of student experience, progression, and obstacles. All qualitative data were coded thematically using Atlas. ti, with the goal of illuminating emerging themes, and quantitative data were reviewed using descriptive statistics. Themes emerging from both data sets were compared, contrasted, and integrated in order to develop consistent findings that would enhance URM student perseverance and persistence in the face of confounding adversities. This study shows that ILSAMP COVID-19 Study participants maintained a commitment to pursuing a career in STEM. The findings of this study also indicate that the participants are stressed by their immediate circumstances and by the ongoing racism of U.S. society. These students ask for additional financial, academic, and networking support during the disruptions caused by the pandemic. More specifically, students request continued advising and connection with STEM professionals who can help them envision and enact a pathway to their own careers in STEM during this tumultuous period. The study validates the importance of key elements of the national LSAMP model as reported by Clewell et al. (Revitalizing the Nation's Talent Pool in STEM, 2006). These are: academic integration, social integration, and professional integration. In addition, it identifies several other factors that are key to student success, including interventions that directly address racial trauma and economic hardship.","[Botanga, Christopher; Jones, LeRoy, II] Chicago State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60628 USA; [Botanga, Christopher; Jones, LeRoy, II] Chicago State Univ, Ctr STEM Educ & Res CSER, Chicago, IL USA; [Blanc, Suzanne; Day, Michelle; Charles, Mariel] Creat Res & Evaluat LLC, Philadelphia, PA USA",Chicago State University; Chicago State University,"Botanga, C (corresponding author), Chicago State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60628 USA.;Botanga, C (corresponding author), Chicago State Univ, Ctr STEM Educ & Res CSER, Chicago, IL USA.",cbotanga@csu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [HRD-1411219, HRD-1911341]; U.S. Department of Education [P382A150041]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education),"Funding was provided through grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Awards # HRD-1411219 and HRD-1911341, as well as the U.S. Department of Education Award # P382A150041 awarded to CB and LJ.

Federal grants can become important levers for building institutional capacity for broadening participation in STEM and transforming HSIs toward better serving Students of Color, specifically as it relates to curricula and pedagogy. In this study, we focus on the engineering faculty at an HSI who are participants in a National Science Foundation-funded, equity-focused professional development program. Operationalizing Bonilla-Silva's color-evasive racial ideology framework, we use content analysis techniques to explore how engineering faculty discuss race and racism as part of the professional development experience. First, we find that engineering faculty largely rely on color-evasive racial frameworks (i.e., abstract liberalism, minimization of racism) when describing their motivations for participating in the program. Moreover, we find that engineering faculty responses depict a range of surprise and familiarity when reflecting on issues of race and racism. Finally, regardless of prior exposure to module concepts, at the end of the program, the majority of action projects reflect a recognition of race and racism as important.","[Espinoza, Kristine Jan Cruz E.; Rincon, Blanca E.] Univ Nevada Vegas, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Psychol Leadership & Higher Educ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Rincon, BE (corresponding author), Univ Nevada Vegas, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Psychol Leadership & Higher Educ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",blanca.rincon@unlv.edu,,"Espinoza, Kristine Jan/0000-0001-7102-4091",,,,,47,2,3,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7102,,EDUC SCI,Educ.

We examined how much African American (AA) women report lifetime experiences of perceived racism or racial discrimination, both personal and group, varied by maternal age. We also investigated whether reports of personal and group racism/racial discrimination were associated with the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational age (SGA) infant and how much maternal age in relation to developmental life stages (adolescence [18years], emerging adulthood [19-24years], and adulthood [25years]) moderated the relationship. Data stem from the Baltimore Preterm Birth Study, a hybrid prospective/retrospective cohort study that enrolled 872 women between March 2000 and July 2004 (analyzed in 2016-2017). Spline regression analyses demonstrated a statistically significant (p value for overall association <0.001) and non-linear (p value=0.044) relationship between maternal age and the overall racism index. Stratified analysis showed experiences of racism overall was associated with a higher odds ratio of delivering an SGA infant among AA women aged 25years (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.08). The overall racism index was not associated with the SGA infant odds ratio for emerging adults (OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.06) or adolescents (OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.66-1.28). Multiple aspects of racism and the intersection between racism and other contextual factors need to be considered.","[Slaughter-Acey, Jaime C.] Drexel Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Syst & Sci Res, 1601 Cherry St,Mail Stop 71044, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA; [Slaughter-Acey, Jaime C.] Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Talley, Lloyd M.; Stevenson, Howard C.] Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Misra, Dawn P.] Wayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth Sci, Detroit, MI 48201 USA",Drexel University; Drexel University; University of Pennsylvania; Wayne State University,"Slaughter-Acey, JC (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Coll Nursing & Hlth Profess, Dept Hlth Syst & Sci Res, 1601 Cherry St,Mail Stop 71044, Philadelphia, PA 19102 USA.",jcs396@drexel.edu; ltalley@gse.upenn.edu; howards@gse.upenn.edu; dmisra@med.wayne.edu,,"Slaughter-Acey, Jaime/0000-0002-8897-1244",NIH [R01 HD038098]; Drexel University,NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Drexel University,"This research was supported by NIH grant R01 HD038098 to Dr. Misra.

Eleven Asian participants shared their counter-narratives through semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that, before the pandemic, participants were regularly subjected to racist acts and attitudes grounded in a deficit view of Asians that treated them as inscrutable foreigners, blamed them as individuals for perceived shortcomings in their home countries, dismissed their expertise outside of technical STEM fields, and failed to recognize their abilities in creative and leadership roles. During the pandemic, the racist acts and attitudes experienced by Asian international college students greatly exacerbated the unprecedented challenges of isolation, limited access to university space and resources, and financial and physical insecurity caused by the pandemic.

It draws on 18 months of ethnographic research to show how women derived a sense of empowerment from becoming involved in their children's schooling. They also turned schools into counter-spaces of sanctuary and support for fellow Latinx parents. The author sees this educational activism spanning both domestic and public school spaces as an expression of m(other)work. M(other)work is the gendered labor of care that supports Latinx children and communities as they fight against intersecting forms of exclusion. This labor, stemming from traumatic experiences of border crossing, is at the heart of emerging forms of immigrant activism in new destinations. In conclusion, the author urges educators to abandon traditional deficit framings of immigrant groups in favor of initiatives that support Latina mothers' educational activism.","[Lanari, Elisa] Max Planck Inst Study Relig & Ethn Divers, Gottingen, Germany",,"Lanari, E (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Study Relig & Ethn Divers, Gottingen, Germany.",lanari@mmg.mpg.de,,"Lanari, Elisa/0000-0002-0836-7611","Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Dissertation Fieldwork Grant [GR 9058]; Graduate School, Northwestern University; National Science Foundation, Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Division of Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences [1528569]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1528569] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Dissertation Fieldwork Grant; Graduate School, Northwestern University; National Science Foundation, Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Division of Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was funded by National Science Foundation, Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences, Division of Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences (Award #1528569), the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, Dissertation Fieldwork Grant (GR 9058), and The Graduate School, Northwestern University.",,69,4,4,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-9870,1466-4356,,ETHNIC RACIAL STUD,Ethn.

Using dialogic syntax and stance theory, the article analyzes media debates surrounding the George Zimmerman murder trial to argue that the parallelism of form between the C-word and the N-word constructs their referents as similarly harmful.

J,"Tijoux, ME; Ambiado, C",,,,"Tijoux, Maria Emilia; Ambiado, Constanza",,,Being a Haitian patient in Chile and experiencing racism in centers of the public health network,INTERDISCIPLINARIA,,,English,Article,,,,,,racism; race; everyday racism; migration; Haitian patients; health,,"The present work is inscribed within the field of contemporary migration studies in Chile, a line of investigation initiated during the nineties. At the time, various people from South America and the Caribbean arrived to the country, which was undergoing a democratic transition and presented itself as a successful economic model. Twenty-five years later, migrants from Haiti began arriving. Despite not constituting the largest group of migrants, they have become one of the most targeted by Chilean society, the media, the political class and government authorities. Since the election of Sebastian Pinera in 2018, certain measures were taken that signaled a policy aimed towards reducing Haitian presence in the country: namely, a humanitarian return plan exclusively for Haitians and the creation of a consular visa as the main permit in order to enter the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they were singled out as disobe-dient to the measures imposed by the state of emergency and the sanitary restrictions put in place. Chilean society agrees with restric-tive norms and policies and looks with suspi-cion at a migrant group that it perceives as different. Chile, a country colonized in the name of humanist and republican values, which upholds cultural homogeneity, does not look favorably on the arrival of migrants from elsewhere in the region, and even less so on a migrant group whose skin color has been negatively evaluated, to the point of linking it to physical, cultural and psychological char-acteristics. This work makes brief references of the context of migrating to Chile, of doing so from Haiti, and of some elements of Haiti's history that make up this particular migratory situation. The proposed objective is to identify racism present within the interactions between public health workers and Haitian patients who approach them for help or treatment in the city of Santiago. This work stems from a larger project that analyzed the sociability and cultural skills of different public health profes-sionals interacting with migrants. Employing a qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals from the public health service and focus groups were organized with Haitian patients. The frame of reference focuses on racism as a system and as a social relationship, on racial discrimination and its effects on people. The words of patients and professionals are analyzed and conclusions are drawn in regards to racism and registered violence as forms of sociability, the latter understood as the way in which two actors interact when one of them is in a position of superiority. These processes need to be reflected upon in order to account for the damages caused to Haitian men, women and children seeking care in the public health network. Considering the importance of the right to migrate in current times and the multiple obstacles that impede it, Haitian life in Chile emerges as a problem when it comes to being attended, cared for or assisted to by health professionals, an issue that is linked to the fact that contemporary migrations have been repeatedly characterized as a problem and not as a social phenomenon that needs to be seriously analyzed with academic accuracy. Racist criticism emerges violently, offending and harming Haitian migrants who, in order to avoid it, sometimes prefer not to go public health centers, to look for alternatives when dealing with the ailments that afflict them, or straightforwardly abandon the possibility of being attended at all. Finally, some guidelines are advanced which may help to overcome these situations by training professionals in order to improve communications between them and Haitian migrants.","[Tijoux, Maria Emilia] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Ambiado, Constanza] Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Tijoux, ME (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",emiliatijoux@uchile.cl; constanza.ambiado@uchile.cl,,,,,,,47,0,0,2,5,CENTRO INTERAMERICANO INVESTIGACIONES PSICOLOGICAS Y CIENCIAS AFINES-CIIPCA,BUENOS AIRES,"TTE GRAL J D PERON 2158, BUENOS AIRES, 00000, ARGENTINA",1668-7027,,,INTERDISCIPLINARIA,Interdisciplinaria,JAN-APR,2023,40,1,,,,,363,377,,10.16888/interd.2023.40.1.22,http://dx.doi.org/10.16888/interd.2023.40.1.22,,,15,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Psychology,7X6LM,,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000914311600022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The authors argue that non-Indigenous educators are often ill equipped to undertake curriculum deconstruction or review. They lack a comprehensive understanding of colonial history, truth telling, racism, and the impact of power dynamics, with its institutional privileging of whiteness. It is often only with this foundational knowledge that staff are positioned to undertake curriculum analysis and ensure that their teaching environments are culturally safe.

COVID-19 has been an unexpected precipitous monitoring system that has exposed the current implemented policies and systems, begging the question, are these goals failing?  Furthermore, may it be equated to failed leadership on a global scale? The UN 17 SDGs is an urgent call for union by all countries - developed and developing - recognizes that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality and spur economic growth. This paper is central to addressing the shortcomings of UN leadership and multilateral organizations. The UN coordinates multilateral organizations' actions in reaching the most marginalized communities (United Nations, 2015). Hence, these outcomes have become more distant to those without means and most in need, a likely consequence of program failure and our globalized world. The pandemic has taught us national solutions to global problems fall short and may only exacerbate the outcome. The authors approach this as a failure of global leadership. The UN's pledge to Leave No One Behind  has undermined its commitment to poverty and inequalities of racism and sectarianism. The UN staff are often unprepared to deal with the issues they have contributed to. They continue to perpetuate the inequalities that stem from racism and discrimination even though the pledge is to leave no one behind. The 17 SDGs are designed to impact citizens' health and livelihood. The goals have direct and indirect effects on women, children and the most marginalized groups residing in urban cities across the globe. This article examines systemic racism and the UN and its impact on the SDGs' agenda.Design/methodology/approach-This article proposes a human-centered approach to address leadership inadequacies in a global public leadership institution using a literature review and contemporary cases.Findings-This article argues a premise for the UN institutions to adapt their leadership approaches to better understand the global communities with whom they serve.Practical implications-This article is directed to multi-lateral leaders and governments in hopes to expose inequities and hypocrisies in order to advance more inclusive and culturally responsive approaches to tackle the most challenging social issues the world faces.Originality/value-This article draws on current events of racism that challenge one of the largest global institutions and can potentially undermine the achievement of meeting the 2030 UN SDGs for any country.","[Ebron, Kutisha T.; Luzynski, Cheyenne; Komanski, Carolynn Nath S.] Univ St Thomas, Inst Ethical Leadership, Miami Gardens, FL 33054 USA; [Luzynski, Cheyenne] West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Komanski, Carolynn Nath S.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA",West Virginia University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ebron, KT (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, Inst Ethical Leadership, Miami Gardens, FL 33054 USA.",kebron@stu.edu; cheyenne.luzynski@mail.wvu.edu; ckomanski@stu.edu,,"Ebron, Kutisha/0000-0002-4171-8911",,,,,75,0,0,2,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2056-4929,2042-8642,,INT J PUBLIC LEADERS,Int.

Among Black Women, experiencing increased gendered racism is associated with higher poorer mental health which includes higher levels of anxiety and depression. To cope with these experiences of gendered racism, Black women often engage in identity shifting by adjusting one's behavior and language to conform to environmental norms. Paradoxically, having a strong sense of one's gendered racial identity has been theorized to potentially protect Black women from the detrimental effects of gendered racism. Two hundred thirty nine young adult U.S. Black women, between the ages of 18 and 35, completed an online survey to examine the role of identity shifting and gendered racial identity centrality on the established link between gendered racism and mental health outcomes, specifically anxiety and depression symptoms. The results indicated that identity shifting did not moderate the associations between gendered racism and anxiety nor depression symptoms. Separate moderation analyses indicated that gendered racial identity centrality moderated the effect of identity shifting on depression but not on anxiety symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of considering identity factors when proposing theories and clinical practices that seek to reduce mental health concerns among young adult U.S. Black women.","[Jones, Maria S.] Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Womack, Veronica] Northwestern Univ, Searle Ctr Adv Teaching & Learning, Evanston, IL USA; [Womack, Veronica] Chicago State Univ, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL USA; [Jeremie-Brink, Gihane] William Paterson Univ, Dept Psychol, Wayne, NJ 07470 USA; [Dickens, Danielle D.] Spelman Coll, Dept Psychol, 350 Spelman Lane, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA",Emory University; Northwestern University; Chicago State University; Spelman College,"Dickens, DD (corresponding author), Spelman Coll, Dept Psychol, 350 Spelman Lane, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA.",ddickens@spelman.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1832141]; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1832141] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the National Science Foundation grant #1832141 which facilitated the completion of the work described in this manuscript.,,65,22,52,2,15,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0360-0025,1573-2762,,SEX ROLES,Sex Roles,AUG,2021,85,3-4,,,,,221,231,,10.1007/s11199-020-01214-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-020-01214-1,,JAN 2021,11,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Social; Women's Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Women's Studies,TU8WY,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000607325200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A key player in this endeavor should be STEM education, which has the potential to equip learners with the skills and knowledge necessary to address intersectional issues such as climate change, health and income disparities, racism, and political divisions. However, in this article we argue that despite the transformative potential of STEM education, it remains far removed from most people's lived experiences and is detached from the real-world social, political, and economic contexts in which it exists. This detachment not only perpetuates existing inequities by failing to meet the specific needs and reflect the experiences of these communities, but it also hampers STEM education's capacity to address the very local and global problems it is purported to solve. By remaining removed from the tangible, real-world contexts in which it exists, STEM education cannot fully harness its potential to better humanity. To address these issues, we propose humanizing STEM education by intentionally and explicitly grounding all work in the recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of all students, regardless of their background. We begin the article by critically examining the typically unspoken pre-existing assumptions or agreements that govern and dictate the norms of teaching and learning within STEM, ways of approaching framing STEM education that we often take for granted as necessary and true. We propose new agreements that expand the ways in which we think about STEM education, in hopes of making STEM education more accessible, inclusive, relevant, responsive, and reparative. Throughout, we deliberate on the notion of being human. We argue that to envision a future of humanistic STEM, one that is intentionally grounded in an ethics of care and equity for all, including the environment, it is necessary to continue to make visible and reimagine the unarticulated assumptions that underlie our current approaches to STEM education and practice.","[Imad, Mays; Rose, Madelyn] Connecticut Coll, Biol Dept, New London, CT 06320 USA; [Imad, Mays] Amer Assoc Coll Nursing, Off Undergrad STEM Educ, Washington, DC USA; [Imad, Mays] Gardner Inst, Brevard, NC 28712 USA; [Imad, Mays] Mind & Life Inst, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Reder, Michael] Connecticut Coll, Joy Shechtman Mankoff Fac Ctr Teaching & Learning, New London, CT 06320 USA",Connecticut College; Connecticut College,"Imad, M (corresponding author), Connecticut Coll, Biol Dept, New London, CT 06320 USA.;Imad, M (corresponding author), Amer Assoc Coll Nursing, Off Undergrad STEM Educ, Washington, DC USA.;Imad, M (corresponding author), Gardner Inst, Brevard, NC 28712 USA.;Imad, M (corresponding author), Mind & Life Inst, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",mimad@conncoll.edu,,,This work was supported by the 2022 Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship awarded to MRo and by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) grant awarded to MI to rethink approaches to diversity and equity in STEM education.; Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI),This work was supported by the 2022 Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship awarded to MRo and by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) grant awarded to MI to rethink approaches to diversity and equity in STEM education.; Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship; Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)(Howard Hughes Medical Institute),This work was supported by the 2022 Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship awarded to MRo and by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) grant awarded to MI to rethink approaches to diversity and equity in STEM education.r This work was supported by the 2022 Connecticut College Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) fellowship awarded to MRo and by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) grant awarded to MI to rethink approaches to diversity and equity in STEM education.,,104,0,0,7,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2504-284X,,FRONT EDUC,Front.

Within a neoliberal context of gentrification, displacement, disinvestment, and privatization, STEM schools have become strategic components of Chicago's 'portfolio district' that serve the interests of racial capitalism in three ways. First, STEM schools provide a claim to fairness in the midst of racist school closures. Second, STEM high schools are a corporate strategy for racially stratified labor force preparation that restricts curriculum and reifies tracking. Third, curriculum restriction prioritizes corporate interests over students' capacity to shape their communities and the world.

Utilizing Critical Race Theory to contextualize and situate this study, this manuscript explored racialized interactions between Black men and their non-Black advisors and colleagues using semi-structured qualitative interviews. The multiple forms of racism that Black men encounter consists of (1) Black male exceptionalism (e.g., the Barack Obama Effect), (2) the expectation that they will be the spokesperson for the entire Black race, (3) the White oppositional gaze directed towards their physical appearance and stature, and (4) that their departments turn a blind eye towards issues of racism. Black men navigate, negotiate, and respond to racism in their departments by resigning from their diversity-focused leadership positions due to their racialized 'token' status, tapping into their spirituality, and by acquiring an arrogant yet humble demeanor to combat racial hostilities.

These concerns are reflected in the deep sense of urgency in Black communities about the need for an overall strategy to stem the tide of exclusions of Black boys. The authors argue that the continuing denial of race and racism in British educational policy is reflected in the intransigence of many schools to consider the differential positioning of Black boys in the wider society and its effect on their educational experiences and opportunities.

Firstly, we turn our attention to the actual and, surprisingly enough, political rejection of multiculturalism. Recently, many European countries have faced various problems with their integration policies. Despite the large number of studies on the race, as well as a number of European and international documents and declarations against racism, a paradoxical phenomenon appeared: the concept of race was restored as a scientific fact. Although the word race was not explicitly mentioned, the concept of ethnicity offered extensive strategic support for so-called backward groups. Humanistic paradigm of legal equality has been replaced by the paradigm of ethnic or racial policies, i.e. policies of collective identity. As it turned out, these policies have failed. The goal of humanistic paradigm was to get rid of the word race's false scientific aura. Humanistic paradigm as a meta-paradigm has accepted the existence of biological differences among individuals and human populations, but there was no need to take them into account when defending its legitimacy or promoting its ideal. We assert that these problems stem from useless attempts at defending scientifically human equality which, however, is not based on scientific evidence, but rather on the ideal of universal equality built up on pillars such as the Christian heritage, western law, and values represented by the human beings' capability of suffering.","[Smihula, Daniel] Stredoeuropska Vysoka Skola Skalici, Skalica 90901, Slovakia; [Hrabovsky, Milan] Fak Socialnych & Ekon Vied UK, Ustav Europskych Studii & Medzinarodych Vztahov, Bratislava 82105 2, Slovakia",,"Smihula, D (corresponding author), Stredoeuropska Vysoka Skola Skalici, Kralovska 386-11, Skalica 90901, Slovakia.",dsmihula@hotmal.com; milan.t.hrabovsky@gmail.com,"Hrabovsky, Milan/H-4413-2014; Šmihula, Daniel/AAH-9374-2019",,,,,,52,0,0,0,4,FILOZOFIA,BRATISLAVA 1,"KLEMENSOVA 19, 813 64 BRATISLAVA 1, SLOVAKIA",0046-385X,,,FILOZOFIA,Filozofia,MAY,2015,70,5,,,,,378,397,,,,,,20,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,CJ7ZT,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000355719600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Institutions of higher education, including minority-serving schools, need to examine institutional racism and other structural barriers that damage the racial identities of Black and Latino/a students in STEM and cause lasting psychological strain.","[McGee, Ebony O.] Vanderbilt Univ, Divers & STEM Educ, Peabody Coll, PMB 230 GPC 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College,"McGee, EO (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Divers & STEM Educ, Peabody Coll, PMB 230 GPC 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",ebony.mcgee@vanderbilt.edu,"McGee, Ebony O./F-1747-2016","McGee, Ebony O./0000-0002-0499-2620",,,,,88,183,302,0,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-8312,1935-1011,,AM EDUC RES J,Am.

Drawing on unique interviews with EU-based ethnic-Chechen emigre Salafis, the article illuminates the ways they draw boundaries and consequently construe their ethnic and racial identities as superior and opposed to Muslims stemming from the Middle East and Central Asia. Below the surface of coherent ideologically shaped self-representations, the diaspora Salafis' identities reflect the idea of Chechnya's mountainous topography being conducive to a superior 'national mentality', racial purity, and cultural uniqueness. Intriguingly, the diaspora-Chechen Salafis' attitudes toward Middle Easterners and Central Asians employ a rhetoric which entails similarities with the notion of imagined geographies and to some extent resembles Western Orientalist discourse. In stark contrast to leading Salafi scholars' statements emphasising a united Muslim identity, which are routinely echoed by outsiders, this article points out the maintenance of strong ethnic-nationalist and racist resentments amongst individual members of this religious community.","[Souleimanov, Emil Aslan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Polit Sci, Dept Secur Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Schwampe, Jasper] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Schwampe, Jasper] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark",Charles University Prague; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Souleimanov, EA (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Polit Sci, Dept Secur Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",souleimanov@fsv.cuni.cz,"Souleimanov, Emil/G-9115-2018; Souleimanov, Emil A./AAQ-3925-2020",,,,,,49,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-183X,1469-9451,,J ETHN MIGR STUD,J.

MethodsWe used data from the Young Asian American Health Survey (YAAHS), an online-recruited sample of AA adolescents (ages 13-17) and young adults (ages 18-29 years) conducted during May 2021 to March 2022. We presented descriptive statistics examining the univariate distribution and bivariate relationships of depression severity, sociodemographic characteristics, and experiences and perceptions of anti-Asian violence. ResultsOur sample (n = 176) comprised AA adolescents and young adults from 17 Asian ethnicities. A quarter said that the frequency and/or severity of their personal experiences of anti-Asian harassment had increased since the pandemic started. 76% indicated feeling less safe now than before the pandemic. Two-thirds reported that their depressive symptoms have increased since the pandemic started. Participants who reported feeling less safe now than before the pandemic were more likely to report increased personal experiences with anti-Asian harassment and increased depression severity since the pandemic started than those who reported feeling as safe or safer before the pandemic (p < 0.01 for both). DiscussionFindings illustrate AA adolescent and young adults are experiencing multiple health and social crises stemming from increased anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. We urge policymakers to strengthen data systems that connect racial discrimination and mental health and to institute prevention measures and anti-racist mental health services that are age- and culturally-appropriate for AA adolescent and young adults.","[Huynh, James; Chien, Jessie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nguyen, Amy T.] Darkness Light, N Charleston, SC USA; [Honda, Delanie] IMentor, New York, NY USA; [Cho, Emily EunYoung; Ngo, Thoai D.] Populat Council, New York, NY USA; [Xiong, Maliya] Wisconsin United Coalit Mutual Assistance Assoc, Wausau, WI USA; [Doan, Tran T.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Gen Acad Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Population Council; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Huynh, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jhuynh93@ucla.edu,"Walther, Cordula/HNI-7449-2023","Huynh, James/0000-0002-8455-7062",,,,,51,5,6,1,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

While the literature has importantly identified and described the myriad ways in which students of color experience exclusion within STEM fields on the basis of race (and, perhaps, other social identity statuses), this area of scholarship is not always theoretically grounded in an understanding of racial hierarchies, processes of racialization, or theories of race and racism. That is, despite the abundant literature on students of color in STEM, there is comparatively limited theoretical attention to race itself, which limits conceptual understanding of the complexities associated with navigating and negotiating STEM contexts. For example, an emphasis on the presumed detrimental or beneficial experiences and outcomes associated with racial minority status may oversimplify the complexity of how race and racism are subjectively experienced at the individual level. Specifically, an individual's attempt to understand, navigate, negotiate, or reappraise their racialized status and persist in an inherently stratified, racialized system of educational opportunity is lost when applying essentialist ideas about race, thus reinforcing dichotomous ideas about advantageous or detrimental consequences of racial minority status. To address this, this paper advances a new conceptual model- the racial reappraisal framework-that more fully accounts for the complex cognitive work students of color engage in when they consider and experience racialization and racism.","[Abrica, Elvira J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Educ Adm, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Abrica, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Educ Adm, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",elvira.abrica@unl.edu,,,,,,,64,1,1,1,1,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1072-8325,1940-431X,,J WOMEN MINOR SCI EN,J.

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to: 1) identify sociodemographic, employment, and stress-related characteristics that increase Latino day laborers' odds of experiencing wage theft; 2) assess the association between wage theft and serious work-related injury; 3) assess the association between wage theft and three indicators of mental health-depression, social isolation, and alcohol use-as a function of wage theft; and 4) assess serious work-related injury as a function of wage theft controlling for mental health. Methods: Secondary data analyses were based on survey data collected from 331 Latino day laborers between November 2013 and July 2014. Regression analyses were conducted to test the relationships described above. Results: Approximately 25% of participants reported experiencing wage theft and 20% reported serious work-related injury. Wage theft was associated with working in construction and was initially associated with work-related injury. Wage theft was not significantly associated with mental health indicators. The association between wage theft and injury became non-significant when controlling for the mental health variables. Conclusions: The hardship and stress associated with wage theft incidents may ultimately lead to more frequent injury. Although we expected an association of wage theft with mental health, we found vulnerability to physical health as indicated by injury incidents. Thus, our basic premise was partially supported: wage theft may act as a stressor that stems from conditions, in part, reflecting structural racism, making workers vulnerable to poorer health.","[Fernandez-Esquer, Maria Eugenia; Ibekwe, Lynn N.; King, Yesmel A.; Durand, Casey P.; Atkinson, John S.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston UT Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot & Behav Sci, Sch Publ & Hlth, Houston, TX USA; [Guerrero-Luera, Rosalia] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston UT Hlth, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Houston, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Fernández-Esquer, ME (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Promot & Prevent Res, 7000 Fannin St,Suite 2518, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Maria.E.Fernandez-Esquer@uth.tmc.edu,"Ibekwe, Lynn N/AAB-1326-2022","Ibekwe, Lynn N/0000-0002-7131-1725",National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities [5R24MD007975-02]; National Cancer Institute [T32CA057712],National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD)); National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"We want to thank the Latino day laborers and other members of our Community Advisory Board for their valuable advice throughout the study.

We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether one's race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by STEM students of color. Results The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other students of color in the sample. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty members, and students to work together to address racism at the campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings reveal the continued presence of anti-Black racism in higher education.","[Lee, Meggan J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Sociol, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Collins, Jasmine D.] Univ Illinois, Educ & Commun, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Harwood, Stacy Anne] Univ Utah, City & Metropolitan Planning Dept, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Mendenhall, Ruby] Univ Illinois, Dept Sociol & African Amer Studies, Carle Illinois Coll Med, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Huntt, Margaret Browne] Univ Illinois, Canc Ctr Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Harwood, SA (corresponding author), Univ Utah, City & Metropolitan Planning Dept, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",harwood@arch.utah.edu,,"Harwood, Stacy/0000-0002-4844-4722; Browne Huntt, Margaret/0000-0001-8523-9480","Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society; Campus Research Board; Multiracial Democracy Initiative; Graduate College Focal Point; University Housing at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society; Campus Research Board; Multiracial Democracy Initiative; Graduate College Focal Point; University Housing at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign","The project was supported by grants from the Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society, Campus Research Board (including the Multiracial Democracy Initiative), Graduate College Focal Point, and University Housing at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.",,87,48,84,2,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-7822,,,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students' perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices - instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) - were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants' perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students' experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked.

The prevailing perception of Asian(Americans) as model minorities masks how their multiple and contradictory positionings in the STEM system perpetuate the neoliberal racial project and reproduce systems of racism and oppression. Through a multidisciplinary analysis of STEM education and industry, we demonstrate that the shifting racialization of Asian(Americans) secures advantages for White Americans by promoting meritocracy and producerism and justifies White supremacy. By serving these functions, the racialization of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system is central to the neoliberal racial project. This paper also suggests how STEM education researchers can reveal and resist, rather than veil and support, the neoliberal racial project in STEM.","[Chen, Grace A.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll Educ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Buell, Jason Y.] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Chen, GA (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll Educ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",grace.a.chen@vanderbilt.edu,,"Chen, Grace A./0000-0002-0344-8180; Buell, Jason/0000-0003-0219-0031",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [1445197],National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under [grant number 1445197].

Yet how instructors think about race and racism can impact whether and how they adopt inclusive practices. We examined how 39 undergraduate STEM instructors noticed anti-Black racialized events that were experienced by students in classroom narratives. We created narrative cases that described multiple common, harmful anti-Black racialized experiences based on extant research and guidance from an expert advisory board. Instructors responded to cases by describing the problems they noticed. Using frameworks of racial noticing and color-evasive racial ideology, we conducted qualitative content analysis of instructor responses. Color-evasive racial ideology was pervasive, with most responses (54%) avoiding any discussion of race, and few responses acknowledging race or racism in more than one event (10%). We characterized six forms of color-evasiveness. This study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that color-evasion is pervasive in STEM culture. Instructors would benefit from professional development that specifically aims to counter color-evasiveness and anti-Blackness in teaching. Furthermore, STEM disciplines must pursue systemic change so that our organizations value, expect, promote, and reward the development and enactment of a critical racial consciousness.","[King, Gretchen P.] Univ Georgia, Owens Inst Behav Res, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Andrews, Tessa C.] Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Andrews, Tessa C.] Univ Georgia, Dept Genet, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Andrews, TC (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Cellular Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;Andrews, TC (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Genet, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",tandrews@uga.edu,,,internal UGA Diversity Research and Scholarship Grant; National Science Foundation [1821023]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Undergraduate Education [1821023] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,internal UGA Diversity Research and Scholarship Grant; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Undergraduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"We thank the advisory board who contributed to the generation and refinement of the cases, including Morgan Beckham, Christin Walls, Osaruese Idehen, Hayliegh Rose, and Brandon Marshall.

Stemming from the emphasis on standards-based accountability are the ideas of rapid school turnaround and the state's role in this process (Peck & Reitzug, 2014; VanGronigen & Meyers, 2019). The current study employed critical policy discourse analysis to examine the media's portrayal of the 2019 determination to continue or terminate state control of the Little Rock School District. The analysis highlights two argumentative frames-one that emphasized neoliberal values in support of continued state control of the district and another that focused on systemic racism as the basis for advocating for local control of the district. These frames, along with their implications for future actions within the educational policy making process, guide the discussion. Our findings suggest sustained community and media participation is needed to bring attention to education policy issues while underscoring the importance of taking a critical stance to assess media coverage.","[Lopez, Trish A.] Univ Arkansas, Springdale Publ Sch, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Riesco, Holly Sheppard] Univ Arkansas, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Fayetteville, NC USA; [Goering, Christian Z.] Univ Arkansas, Curriculum & Instruct, Fayetteville, NC USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Lopez, TA (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Springdale Publ Sch, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",trishl@uark.edu; hriesco@uark.edu; cgoering@uark.edu,,,,,,,81,0,0,0,0,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV, MARY LOU FULTON TEACHERS COLL",PHOENIX,"PO BOX 37100, PHOENIX, AZ 85069 USA",,1068-2341,,ED POLICY ANAL ARCH,Educ.

The pervasive white and heteronormative culture of the STEM environment has contributed to Women of Color feeling isolated, hyper-visible, and invisible as they contend with racism, sexism, and gendered racial microaggressions. Scholars have found that counterspaces are key sites to support the persistence of Women of Color in STEM and ameliorate the negative psychological effects of navigating oppressive STEM milieus. Missing from the current literature is research on how counterspaces contribute to Women of Color's STEM persistence. This study sought to fill this gap in the literature by understanding the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color in the I CAN PERSIST STEM initiative, a multigenerational counterspace designed to support the holistic persistence of Women of Color in STEM. Steeped in the theoretical conceptualization of counterspaces, and using a case study methodological approach, we found that the multigenerational counter-storytelling and support from Women of Color in STEM, as well as the embodiment of holistic wellness, and justice-focused mentor-teaching supported STEM persistence intentions among undergraduate Women of Color in the sample. Furthermore, participants described being able to reconcile their STEM identities with their need to be active in addressing and mitigating the inequities in their communities, while also prioritizing their well-being and rejecting the STEM culture of overwork and burnout.","[Wilkins-Yel, Kerrie G.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Counseling & Sch Psychol, 1000 William T,Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Williamson, Francesca A.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Priddie, Christen; Gallimore, Shanalee] Indiana Univ, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy Studies, Bloomington, IN USA; [Francis, Dionne Cross] Univ N Carolina, Dept Culture Curriculum & Teacher Educ, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Davis-Randolph, Jasmine L.] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Wilkins-Yel, KG (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Counseling & Sch Psychol, 1000 William T,Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",kerrie.wilkins@umb.edu,"Williamson, Francesca/KIE-1491-2024","Williamson, Francesca/0000-0002-7065-7089; Wilkins, Kerrie/0000-0002-7429-9266; Cross Francis, Dionne/0000-0001-6851-8867",National Science Foundation [2013465]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Directorate for STEM Education [2013465] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Directorate for STEM Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2013465",,95,3,5,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4308,1098-2736,,J RES SCI TEACH,J.

It is one of the strongest interpellations of colonialism and racism as inherent vectors of capitalism and Western modernity and even could be considered as a precursor to critiques of international development thinking and practices. The article includes a short biography of Cesaire, and goes on to address how Discourse offers a non-Eurocentric reading of European history, arguing that Nazism is not an outgrowth of or an exception in European history but the ultimate effect of a civilization that justifies colonization. It then describes Cesaire's post-war aspirations for decolonization as a possible third way forward for Europe, breaking with the binarism of capitalism/communism, and outlines questions involving the tensions in the demands for equality and recognition of differences, which stemmed from his involvement in the departmentalization of Martinique in 1946, and the problems that French universalism caused for this process. Rereading Discourse today, there is a distinct blind spot in its androcentrism, and in Cesaire's ignoring of Black women thinkers who were his contemporaries. However, the text still offers original and creative proposals that subaltern groups in Latin America (racialized groups, women, LGBTQ+) can use to observe elements of reality that colonizers and dominant groups are reluctant to acknowledge.","[Viveros-Vigoya, Mara] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Human Sci, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Viveros-Vigoya, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ciencias Humanas, Escuela Estudios Genero, Unidad Camilo Torres, Sede Bogota Carrera 44 45-67,Bloque A5, Bogota 111321, Colombia.",mviverosv@unal.edu.co,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0038-0261,1467-954X,,SOCIOL REV,Sociol.

Often, funding for these programs has been reduced or eliminated for graduate students. National conferences, sponsored by national societies, partially filled the vacuum, offering equity-minded mentoring that affirmed STEM identities.DiscussionWe propose that doctoral students benefit from institutionally-maintained diversity programs that address racial disparities.

Second, we share that facilitators and most white participants hesitated and sometimes directly avoided conversations about historical and contemporary exclusion in STEM, especially regarding racism.

Instead of fostering the strengths Latine students possess that help them succeed despite these obstacles, the field of STEM education has traditionally examined these students' experiences and challenges through a deficit lens. Deficit perspectives posit that any existing disparities in educational outcomes in STEM for Latine students are a product of the students' lack of interest in STEM fields, poor academic preparation and/or motivation, among other 'faults.' In this manner, this deficit approach absolves educators, educational institutions, administrators, and researchers from any responsibility in mediating the disparate outcomes and negates the roles that outdated pedagogical practices, structural racism, discrimination and disciplinary bias have in limiting Latine students' success in STEM. These deficit-understandings of these inequities are pervasive in all aspects of STEM education, guiding curricular choices, pedagogical approaches, assessment designs, interventions and even how STEM fields define knowledge and success. To counter these harmful constructions, this article discusses how STEM educators can draw on Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) and Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) epistemologies to foster learning ecologies that draw on Latine students' cultural strengths rather than deficits. To this end, this article introduces LatCrit and CCW frameworks in the context of STEM education, and combines them to propose an asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approach to STEM curriculum design and teaching. It also contributes guiding questions and application examples STEM educators can reference to advance asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approaches that promote justice and equity within STEM classrooms and beyond. Contributing to this underdeveloped line of scholarship in the field of STEM, we apply these critical frames to help educators (re)imagine postsecondary STEM pedagogies and reforms around the wealth of skills, dispositions, and cultural practices that Latine students possess.","[Negrete, Ambar Hernandez; Caporale, Natalia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mouavangsou, Kaozong N.

Participants did not discuss racism and White supremacy as factors that contribute to negative racial climate. Instead, they indicated a weak STEM pipeline, and lack of faculty engagement created negative climate. Because participants did not attend to how racism and White supremacy fostered negative climate, their strategies (e.g., increased recruitment, committees, workshops) left systemic racism intact and (un)intentionally amplified labor for racially minoritized graduate students and faculty champions who often led change efforts with little support. These findings can help move departments away from intervention-centered models of change and toward more systemic approaches that contest how racialized organizations operate.","[Perez, Rosemary J.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Higher & Postsecondary Educ, 610 East Univ Ave,Room 2117, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Motshubi, Rudisang] Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, Higher Educ Program, 1620 Lagomarcino Hall,901 Stange Rd, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rodriguez, Sarah L.] Virginia Tech, Dept Engn Educ, 373 Goodwin Hall,MC 0218,635 Prices Fork Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Iowa State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Perez, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Higher & Postsecondary Educ, 610 East Univ Ave,Room 2117, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",perezrj@umich.edu; motshubi@iastate.edu; srodriguez@vt.edu,"Perez, Rosemary J./R-3884-2017","Perez, Rosemary J./0000-0002-4005-4172; Rodriguez, Sarah L./0000-0002-3409-7096",National Science Foundation (NSF) [1647104],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: this research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [under award #1647104].

The Infant-Parent Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has extended its pioneering infant and early childhood mental health consultation to perinatal service systems applying an infant mental health approach to programs caring for expecting and new parents. In partnership with two nursing programs, UCSF consultants direct their efforts at supporting reflective practice capacities and use-of-self in patient-provider relationships. Both nursing programs serve vulnerable groups of expectant and new parents who grapple with challenges to health and well-being stemming from structural racism. As reflective capacities are supported within the consultation case conferences, providers spontaneously identify the need for tools to effectively address issues of race, class, and culture and to combat structural racism throughout the healthcare system. Policies and procedures that uphold structural racism cease to be tolerable to providers who bring their full selves to the work that they are trained to do. Using these nurse consultation partnerships as organizational case studies, this article describes a range of challenges that arise for providers and delineates steps to effective engagement toward reproductive justice.","[Silverman, Miriam E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Psychiat, Infant Parent Program, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA; [Hutchison, Margaret S.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA",University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Silverman, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Infant Parent Program, 1001 Potrero Ave, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA.",miriam.silverman@ucsf.edu,,,Bella Vista Foundation,Bella Vista Foundation,"M.

This essay addresses the particularly vexing issue of the origins of Gobineau's racism from the perspective of his affiliation with French royalists in the 1840s and challenges the existing scholarship on the derivation of L'Essai sur l'inegalite des races humaines by placing the Essai in the context of his international experience as a member of the French diplomatic corps. Although disillusioned with legitimist politics during the July Monarchy, Gobineau never abandoned his youthful ideological priorities. Front the perspective of Ins royalist past, the Essai appears as part of an extended rumination on the decadence of the French aristocracy and its failure to stem the tide of revolution and bureaucratic centralization. As such, Gobineau's racism can best be understood as a royalist heresy rather than a continuation of his aristocratic elitism or a clean break with his earlier preoccupations.","Washington State Univ, Dept Hist, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Kale, S (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Hist, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",kale@wsu.edu,,,,,,,31,8,14,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1479-2443,,,MOD INTELLECT HIST,Mod.

This study uses Jones' 'Three Levels of Racism' theory and an intersectional lens to explore how racism shapes the experience of maternal health care access among Garo Indigenous women in Bangladesh. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 women of diverse backgrounds and pregnancy statuses using snowball sampling. Thematic analysis, incorporating inductive and deductive approaches, was employed for data analysis. The findings reveal a significant deviation from Jones' theory regarding the level of internalized racism within the specific context of Garo Indigenous women's experiences. Jones' theory usually focuses on how racism is internalized due to institutional and personally-mediated factors. On the contrary, this study uncovers a unique theme: 'women agency.' This theme emerges as a robust response among the Garo Indigenous women to their encounters with institutional and personally-mediated racism, highlighting their cultural resistance and resilience. The findings suggest that the complex relationship between these two forms of racism contributes to the strengthening of agency among Garo Indigenous women. Their agency stems from avoiding hospitals that disrespect their culture, manifesting their cultural resistance practice against the encountered racism at the institutional and relational levels. To increase biomedical healthcare access among Garo Indigenous women, it is recommended to address racism through intercultural competency training with the 'cultural safety' 'cultural humility' approach. This approach would foster inclusivity and empowerment, recognizing the agency of Garo women in healthcare decisions. Additionally, it would facilitate constructive dialogues between clinicians and Garo Indigenous women, acknowledging the shared experiences of racism within the latter group.","[Chowdhury, Suban Kumar] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Int Relat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh",University of Rajshahi,"Chowdhury, SK (corresponding author), Univ Rajshahi, Dept Int Relat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.",skc_ruir@ru.ac.bd,"Chowdhury, Suban Kumar/AFO-3163-2022","Chowdhury, Suban Kumar/0000-0003-0314-5996",,,,,83,0,0,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,NOV 30,2023,18,11,,,,,,,e0294710,10.1371/journal.pone.0294710,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294710,,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,EO1M0,38032894,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:001139775100107,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research participants were beneficiaries of affirmative action programs enrolled in these programs at the Federal University of Alfenas (n=390), who responded to a survey instrument called the Scale of Academic, Social, and Survival Experiences in the STEM (EASS-STEM). For the analysis, we used correlations, Spearman's test, chi-square significance test, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results indicate that students between the ages of 20 and 30 clearly identify aspects related to racial microaggressions. Additionally, self-identified Black students were the ones who experienced racial microaggressions more intensely, even surpassing the scores of self-identified mixed-race (Pardo) students, who also fall within the group of Black students in Brazil. This highlights that skin color is directly related to the experiences of racism and racial microaggressions faced by students. Despite overcoming the barrier of access, Black affirmative-action students from STEM programs continue to face the challenge of academic survival due to the structural violence they experience throughout their journey in the program and at the university.","[Lopes, Ronaldo Andre] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [da Silva, Guilherme Henrique Gomes] Univ Fed Alfenas, Alfenas, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Alfenas,"Lopes, RA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil.",ronaldoalopes@outlook.com; guilherme.silva@unifal-mg.edu.br,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,2,LUCAS EMMANUEL MISSERI,MAR DEL PLATA,"LUCAS EMMANUEL MISSERI, MAR DEL PLATA, 00000, ARGENTINA",1852-9488,,,PROMETEICA,Prometeica,,2023,,27,,,,,389,399,,10.34024/prometeica.2023.27.15320,http://dx.doi.org/10.34024/prometeica.2023.27.15320,,,11,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,P9NT3,,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:001053879900036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Borders are being resurrected, despite Schengen and European Union (EU) agreements, in an effort to control the movement of populations.

This paper compares the predictions ofThe camp of the saintsto events in Europe today and critiques the book's conclusions with regard to what is an ancient phenomenon: movements of migrants from surplus to deficit labor settings. The paper will also evaluate the response to migrants in the United States under its populist president, Donald Trump, and will review related issues in other parts of the world: Turkey, Russia, and Canada. Contrary to Raspail's predictions, world leaders will need to accept what has already become a de facto reality: large scale admission of migrants and refugees to the EU and North America, as full citizens, will be the only realistic way to preserve prosperity in the years to come.","[Jarvis, G.

Moreover, the anxieties endemic to a race-based culture have the potential to thwart our most earnest efforts to make and maintain good connection. To adopt the feminist perspective, that the personal is political, is to acknowledge that no relationship can remain unscathed when power and value are differentially accorded based on racial group membership. Three examples from clinical practice will be used to illustrate how racial anxiety impedes movement toward authenticity, mutuality, and empowerment in intimate relationships. In these examples, three biracial women who identify as black navigate the racial stratifications that contaminate the inevitable conflicts in their relationships with parents, mentors, and lovers. Because of the multilayered anxieties stemming from living and loving in a racially stratified culture, conflicts, which might otherwise be the source of growth and deeper connection, become rigidified and immobilizing. In addition to examining the debilitating impact of racial anxiety, the presentation will highlight the relational processes that facilitate healing, resilience, and mutual empowerment.","[Walker, Maureen] JBMTI, Wellesley, MA USA; [Walker, Maureen] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Walker, M (corresponding author), JBMTI, 106 Cent St, Wellesley, MA USA.",jbmti@wellesley.edu,,,,,,,7,1,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0270-3149,1541-0315,,WOMEN THER,Women Ther.,,2008,31,2-4,,,,,71,85,,10.1080/02703140802145938,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02703140802145938,,,15,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Women's Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology; Women's Studies,321KV,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000257304600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article we discuss how anti-Blackness is pervasive in science and mathematics education, especially for young learners. We also address why teacher educators must disrupt anti-Black racism in our work with elementary teacher candidates and in our research. We argue that to do this work and disrupt anti-Blackness, elementary teacher educators and teacher candidates need political clarity (Beauboeuf-LaFontant, 1999). Political clarity is the understanding of how structural and school inequalities work to (re)produce differential learning experiences for minoritized learners. We offer suggestions for how teacher educators can further develop their teacher candidates' political clarity. Drawing upon our prior research, course assignments, and experiences as Black women educators and teacher educators, we share examples of how an individual's political clarity can be developed within science and mathematics methods courses. In doing so, we build upon prior research in STEM teacher education on how teachers come to see teaching as a political act and engage in the hard work of equity-focused STEM teaching.","[Madkins, Tia C.] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Educ, 1912 Speedway,Stop D5500, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Morton, Karisma] Univ North Texas, Coll Educ, 1155 Union Circle, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Madkins, TC (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Coll Educ, 1912 Speedway,Stop D5500, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",tmadkins@austin.utexas.edu,,"Madkins, Tia/0000-0002-2555-9025; Morton, Karisma/0000-0003-1054-3554",,,,,103,20,23,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1492-6156,1942-4051,,CAN J SCI MATH TECHN,Can.

It is not a coincidence that certain groups of people living in the United States experience higher premature death rates or poorer health outcomes than others. For centuries, racial and ethnic as well as geographic differences in health outcomes have been part of the American landscape, so entrenched in society that many people fail to recognize that health inequities were intentionally derived. A national crisis tends to magnify inequities in our society, but even more alarming is the fact that as the country becomes more racially and ethnically diverse in the coming years, the health inequities are projected to worsen if we do not proactively and immediately address them. As we continue to grapple with the lasting impact of the pandemic, it is of vital importance that we utilize this time to acknowledge, understand, and seriously address the health inequities that have historically plagued the country for over 400 years. As the United States works overtime to stem the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, it must also work equally hard to move in a more equitable, inclusive, and healthier direction, not only because of the more than 83 000 Americans dying prematurely each year but also because of the economic and national security toll it will have if not effectively addressed.","[Dawes, Daniel E.; Dunlap, Nelson J.; Johnson, Shaneeta M.] Morehouse Sch Med, Satcher Hlth Leadership Inst, 720 Westview Dr, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Johnson, Shaneeta M.] Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Surg, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA",Morehouse School of Medicine; Morehouse School of Medicine,"Johnson, SM (corresponding author), Morehouse Sch Med, Satcher Hlth Leadership Inst, 720 Westview Dr, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA.",smjohnsonmd@aol.com,,,,,,,41,1,1,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1348,1555-9823,,AM SURGEON,Am.

However, persistent social inequities in STEM domains emerge early for Black and Latinx adolescents, creating numerous barriers to their pursuit of STEM. Developmental and motivational theories highlight parents as a source of strength and support for students' STEM motivational beliefs. We conducted a systematic review of the existing work on parents' STEM socialization processes that shape Black and Latinx adolescents' STEM motivational beliefs. As part of this goal, we examined the variability within Black adolescents and within Latinx adolescents based on (a) other demographic factors (e.g., gender) and (b) racial/ethnic promotive and inhibitive factors (e.g., racism). The systematic literature search and eligibility screening yielded 36 relevant peer-reviewed, empirical journal articles published between January 2000 and January 2020. Overall, a majority of studies found support for positive relations between parents' STEM-specific support and adolescents' motivational beliefs among Black and Latinx families. Additionally, most studies included analyses within each racial/ethnic group, and about half of all articles included racial/ethnic promotive or inhibitive factors, such as familism or racism. In our discussion, we highlight an agenda for future research and discuss bridging theoretical perspectives to better position research to more accurately describe STEM motivation among youth from historically underrepresented groups.","[Starr, Christine R.; Tulagan, Nestor; Simpkins, Sandra D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, 401 E Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA 92617 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Starr, CR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Educ, 401 E Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.",cstarr1@uci.edu,"Simpkins, Sandra/B-9845-2015","Tulagan, Nestor/0000-0001-9491-1929; Starr, Christine/0000-0002-8662-0387",National Science Foundation [DRL-1760757],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),A National Science Foundation Grant (DRL-1760757) to Sandra Simpkins and Jacquelynne Eccles supported this project.,,106,14,18,3,36,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1040-726X,1573-336X,,EDUC PSYCHOL REV,Educ.

At the undergraduate level, Black men encountered racial stereotyping and were self-conscious of their gender and race due to being underrepresented in their STEM courses.

Findings underscore the inequities that continue to pervade STEM and highlight opportunities for transforming disciplinary and institutional cultures, particularly within HSI STEM transfer pathways, where there is great potential for these diverse institutions to support, validate, and benefit from the unique contributions of WOC.","[Herrera, Felisha A.; Rodriguez-Operana, Victoria C.] San Diego State Univ, Res & Equ Scholarship Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Sanchez, Gabriela Kovats] San Diego State Univ, Nat Resource Ctr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Sanchez, Gabriela Kovats] San Diego State Univ, Ctr Intercultural Relat, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Cerrillos, Aileen; Marquez, Briana] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; California State University System; San Diego State University; California State University System; San Diego State University; California State University System; San Diego State University,"Herrera, FA (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Res & Equ Scholarship Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",,,"Rodriguez-Operana, Victoria/0000-0001-7208-6606; Kovats Sanchez, Gabriela/0000-0003-2271-1922",National Science Foundation under NSF [1832528/1644990],National Science Foundation under NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF No. 1832528/1644990.

We find concerning issues in analytic strategy and analysis as well, many stemming from a failure to account for the serious underreporting of services in NCANDS, and the wide variability in data quality and consistency across states. We also found what we consider to be issues with their statistical analysis.

Evidence of this includes AI systems that perpetuate racial and gender biases, medical devices that are incompatible with non-White medical needs, and hiring algorithms that prioritize the White male experience. Though not a panacea, greater representation of traditionally marginalized groups in the STEM workforce will help reduce and safeguard against digital racism, sexism, and ableism. Advocates of greater representation in STEM fields suggest that makerspace pedagogy and design that is rooted in equity and inclusivity can attract students from traditionally marginalized groups and make STEM more accessible and welcoming to all. To this end, this paper proposes a modification of the TPACK theoretical framework (Koehler and Mishra in Contemp Issues Tech Teach Educ 9(1):60-70, 2009) that centers knowledge of technological and inclusive practices in Makerspaces, giving rise to the Maker Technology, Pedagogy, Inclusion, and Content Knowledge (MakerTPICK) theoretical framework. Additionally, this paper presents the Makerspace Planning, Implementation, Establishment, and Reassessment (PIER) conceptual framework. This framework outlines the process for makerspace leaders to create and sustain an inclusive makerspace through the MakerTPICK framework, be they teachers in a school setting or makerspace coordinators outside of the field of K-12 education. The paper describes future implications for these frameworks in terms of practical applications for makerspaces and applied to research settings.","[Nichols, Lynn] Towson Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Learning Technol Design & Sch Lib Media, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Gorsky, Rachel] Gilman Sch, Inst Res & Data Analyt, 5407 Roland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Corum, Kimberly] Towson Univ, Dept Math, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University; University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Nichols, L (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Learning Technol Design & Sch Lib Media, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",lnicho10@students.towson.edu; rgorsky@gilman.edu; kcorum@towson.edu,,"Nichols, Lynn/0000-0002-5379-564X",,,,,82,1,1,15,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1042-1629,1556-6501,,ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES,ETR&D-Educ.

Structural changes to admissions processes that can improve equity of admissions decisions and reduce correlations between admissions decisions and demographic data include using holistic review or composite scores that quantize more components of an application, removing hard limits on course requirements, admitting students as a cohort instead of to individual faculty sponsors, and diversifying admissions committees. Some alternative scoring methods attempt to measure personality traits, but performing these measurements during admissions may present difficulties. Bridge programs-whether they are implemented as collaborations with a minority-serving institution, a personalized educational program for each student admitted to a program, or a stand-alone program before the doctoral degree program-may be able to improve both recruitment and retention of students with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities in their field of study.

The purpose of this inquiry was to understand the perceptions of 34 high-school students about race and gender representation in STEM. Students participated in a 3-week, university-sponsored summer programme geared toward teaching and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). At the end of the programme, we interviewed students about STEM in their community, STEM role models, potentially working in a STEM field, barriers to STEM, and why they think White men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields. Guided by a critical framework with an intersectional lens, qualitative content analysis of interview data centered on the descriptive codes race and gender using a constant comparative analytic approach. Results indicated that participants (1) drew on family role models in STEM, (2) used White privilege and patriarchy at varying levels to explain exclusion from STEM, (3) described limited, stereotypical, and hidden depictions of race and gender in STEM, and (4) often perceived STEM as pushed while not explicitly associating STEM with helping, or giving back to their community. Implications drawn from participant perspectives call for educational endeavors that expand dominant conceptions of who and what is considered STEM, center students' families and communities, utilize a problem-based approach positioning STEM as a tool for social justice, and include direct conversations about gendered racism and stereotypes.","[Martin, Anne E.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Educ Policy Studies, 33 Gilmer St SE, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Fisher-Ari, Teresa R.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Early Childhood & Elementary Educ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Martin, AE (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Educ Policy Studies, 33 Gilmer St SE, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",Amartin61@gsu.edu,,"Martin, Anne/0000-0003-0737-5836",US Department of Education Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships Program: CREST-Ed: Collaborations and Resources for Encouraging and Supporting Transformation in Education [U336S140036]; Project NURTURE: Network for Urban and Rural Teachers United for Residencey Excellence [U336S140036],US Department of Education Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships Program: CREST-Ed: Collaborations and Resources for Encouraging and Supporting Transformation in Education; Project NURTURE: Network for Urban and Rural Teachers United for Residencey Excellence,This work was supported by the US Department of Education Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships Program: CREST-Ed: Collaborations and Resources for Encouraging and Supporting Transformation in Education under Grant U336S140036 and Project NURTURE: Network for Urban and Rural Teachers United for Residencey Excellence under Grant U336S140036.,,63,13,17,6,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-8326,1098-237X,,SCI EDUC,Sci.

Results suggest that when women's ethnicity matched that of a fictious role model scientist, participants were faster to associate the self with science-based words, indicating greater implicit identification with STEM. Findings support the call for tailored intervention materials when attempting to retain women of color in fields that are largely White and male-dominated. Women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related careers are an underrepresented population due to the stigma and sexism they often face. Hispanic and Latina women are further underrepresented in STEM and experience double jeopardy due to sexism and racism. Due to factors such as these, women, and especially women of color, are often pushed out of their academic and career paths in STEM fields, further exacerbating what has been termed the leaky pipeline phenomenon. The present study seeks to create and evaluate a comic book-style intervention intended to promote the retention of women, and in particular Hispanic/Latina women, in STEM fields. Following exposure to a comic book that depicted a female scientist-vigilante who was either non-Hispanic/Latina White or a Hispanic/Latina, we assessed female STEM majors' implicit identification and self-reported group identification with STEM-based fields. Analyses revealed a significant two-way interaction such that when participants' ethnicity matched that of the vigilante's, implicit identification as a woman in STEM was stronger compared to instances in which a mismatch occurred. Hispanic/Latina participants who read about a Hispanic/Latina vigilante associated science and self words faster relative to Hispanic/Latina participants who read about a non-Hispanic/Latina White vigilante. Results did not support the matching hypothesis for explicit group identification. Ethnicity of female role models is an influential factor to consider when developing interventions to recruit and retain women in STEM, as well as the extent to which these materials increase women's identification with STEM-based fields. Recommendations for future research of similar intervention approaches are discussed.","[Crane, Phoenix R.; Talley, Amelia E.; Pina-Watson, Brandy] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, POB 42051, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Crane, PR (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, POB 42051, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",phoenix.crane@ttu.edu,"Crane, Phoenix/JDW-3523-2023","Crane, Phoenix/0000-0002-6638-5674; Talley, Amelia/0000-0003-2367-0034",Graduate School's Thesis/Dissertation Research Award at Texas Tech University,Graduate School's Thesis/Dissertation Research Award at Texas Tech University,This project was funded by the Graduate School's Thesis/Dissertation Research Award at Texas Tech University.

Using constructs and tenets of CRT, this paper specifically explores how race and racism in post-secondary STEM education exacerbate the problem while using contextual factors as a guide.

However, the impact of racial/ethnic disparities in the context of pediatric palliative care is less well understood even in high-acuity patient populations such as stem cell transplant patients. We investigated racial/ethnic differences in the utilization of inpatient palliative care consultations (IPCCs) for pediatric stem cell transplant patients. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Pediatric Health Information System database. A generalized linear mixed effects model was developed to assess demographic and clinical characteristics associated with the likelihood of receiving IPCC. SETTING: Thirty-eight tertiary pediatric hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for any indication from January 2017 to December 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1,193 inpatient encounters studied, 12% (n = 143) included a palliative care consult. IPCC rates varied across hospitals with a median rate of 5.97% (interquartile range, 0.00-20.71). In multivariable analyses, Hispanic/Latinx patients were 59% less likely to receive IPCC compared with non-Hispanic White patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.78). This difference persisted after adjusting for all other sociodemographic and clinical factors. In terms of the other clinical characteristics, having a malignant condition and mechanical ventilation were associated with significantly increased odds of receiving IPCC for the entire cohort (OR Malignancy: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07-3.51; OR Mechanical Ventilation: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.36-4.13). The remainder of the variables were not found to be significantly associated with IPCC. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic differences exist in the likelihood of receiving palliative care consultations among hospitalized pediatric stem cell transplant recipients. Evaluating the impact of systemic racism and social determinants on palliative care medicine as well as standardizing early integration of IPCC may potentially mitigate disparities in this population.","[McKee, Maya N.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Palama, Brett K.] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Pediat, Comer Childrens Hosp, Chicago, IL USA; [Hall, Matt] Childrens Hosp Assoc, Lenexa, KS USA; [LaBelle, James L.] Univ Chicago, Comer Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Hematol Oncol & Stem Cell Transplanta, Chicago, IL USA; [Bohr, Nicole L.] Univ Chicago, Dept Nursing Res & EBP, Med Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Bohr, Nicole L.] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Surg, Sect Vasc Surg & Endovasc Therapy, Chicago, IL USA; [Hoehn, K.

A discrete survival analysis was performed on 822 adult patients with AML from 6 urban cancer centers and revealed inferior survival among NHB (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.22) and Hispanic (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.79) patients compared with NHW patients. A multilevel analysis of disparities was then conducted to investigate the contribution of neighborhood measures of structural racism on racial/ethnic differences in survival. Census tract disadvantage and affluence scores were individually calculated. Mediation analysis of hazard of leukemia death between groups was examined across 6 composite variables: structural racism (census tract disadvantage, affluence, and segregation), tumor biology (European Leukemia Network risk and secondary leukemia), health care access (insurance and clinical trial enrollment), comorbidities, treatment patterns (induction intensity and transplant utilization), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission during induction chemotherapy. Strikingly, census tract measures accounted for nearly all of the NHB-NHW and Hispanic-NHW disparity in leukemia death. Treatment patterns, including induction intensity and allogeneic transplant, and treatment complications, as assessed by ICU admission during induction chemotherapy, were additional mediators of survival disparities in AML. This is the first study to formally test mediators for observed disparities in AML survival and highlights the need to investigate the mechanisms by which structural racism interacts with known prognostic and treatment factors to influence leukemia outcomes.","[Abraham, Ivy Elizabeth] UChicago Med Ingalls Mem Hosp, Harvey, IL USA; [Rauscher, Garth H.; Acevedo-Mendez, Maria; Galvin, John P.] Univ Illinois, Canc Ctr, Div Epidemiol & Biostat UIC, Chicago, IL USA; [Patel, Anand Ashwin; Stock, Wendy] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Hematol Oncol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Pearse, William B.; Burkart, Madelyn; Goparaju, Krishna; Altman, Jessica K.] Northwestern Univ, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Rajakumar, Priya; Dave, Ami; Larson, Melissa L.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Div Hematol Oncol & Stem Cell Transplant, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Aleem, Ahmed; Gomez, Richard; Carlson, Kylie; Tsai, Stephanie B.; Berg, Stephanie] Loyola Univ Med Ctr, Div Hematol & Oncol, Maywood, IL 60153 USA; [Bharadwaj, Sushma; Paydary, Koosha; Zia, Maryam] John H Stroger Jr Hosp Cook Cty, Div Hematol & Oncol, Chicago, IL USA; [Quigley, John G.; Khan, Irum] Univ Illinois, Canc Ctr, Div Hematol & Oncol UIC, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; Ann & Robert H.

This study's conceptual framework put research-practice partnership in conversation with abolitionist teaching (Love, 2019) and community cultural wealth to explore access to STEM teaching and learning. We highlight the experiences of four secondary science teacher candidates through an embedded single case study. Data sources included observation field notes, microteaching reflections, semi-structured individual interviews, and lesson plans, which were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory approaches. Findings revealed that the teacher candidates embraced the concept of abolitionist teaching to inform their microteaching experiences by leveraging social justice standards and emancipatory pedagogies. The participants developed science lessons that honored students' cultural capital through critical readings, discussions, and reflections. Furthermore, the RPP between I AM STEM and the partnering university provided supports to contextualize and humanize science learning for Black and Brown children in online learning spaces. To expose and dismantle racism in science education, we must reimagine our science teacher preparation programs and courses. Thus, emancipating STEM education means engaging in the struggle toward humanity and collective healing. Abolitionist teaching within the context of science education does not require another reform effort. To disrupt systemic oppression, we must demand restorative justice and engage in direct transformative action.","[Louis, Vanessa N.; King, Natalie S.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Middle & Secondary Educ Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"King, NS (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, GSU Coll Educ & Human Dev, 30 Pryor St Suite 600, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",natalieking@gsu.edu,,"Louis, Vanessa/0000-0003-0300-1490; King, Natalie/0000-0002-4465-1409",National Science Foundation [1852889]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1852889] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1852889.,,50,9,11,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1046-560X,1573-1847,,J SCI TEACH EDUC,J.

As part of a larger interview study, 183 college seniors from diverse gender and race backgrounds were asked their thoughts on whether the experience of being a STEM major was different for people of different races and genders. We use a framework of science as White property, derived from critical race theory, to frame this study and results. Results White men were largely unaware of any impact of race or gender. In contrast, women of color overwhelmingly report, consistent with results from a large body of prior research, that both race and gender impact their experiences as STEM majors. Students who acknowledged race and gender impacts did not always attribute these impacts to cultural or systemic factors (i.e., some reported women are underrepresented because they are less interested in STEM rather than a structural reason). Impacts identified that were attributable to systemic factors included impacts related to being a demographic minority (i.e., intimidation, feeling out of place, feeling pressure to work harder) and/or discrimination (i.e., job discrimination, bias against women or people of color and cultural assumptions implying the superiority of White people and men). A small number of students (mostly White women) stated that women or people of color benefit from their underrepresented status, often attributing this benefit to a perception of extra encouragement and opportunities. A common theme across categorizations was that women and students of color work harder than men and White people either because they are perceived to be harder workers or as a response to the sexism and racism they encounter. Conclusions We found that White men are largely unaware of the impacts of race or gender on the pursuit of a STEM degree. Additionally, with the exception of women of color, students are less likely to perceive race as having an impact on the experiences of students than gender. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future work related to gender and race representation in STEM.","[Dancy, Melissa; Rainey, Katherine] Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, UCB390, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Stearns, Elizabeth; Mickelson, Roslyn; Moller, Stephanie] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Sociol, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Dancy, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Phys, UCB390, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",melissa.dancy@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation [DUE-0969286, DRL-1420363, DRL1420350]; University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Open Access Fund,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support provided by the National Science Foundation award numbers DUE-0969286, DRL-1420363, and DRL1420350.

The history of modern philology however demonstrates that this can only be understood as a demand. All too often, philological conceptions went hand in glove with a deterministic anthropology. Whereas current research on the nexus between philology and racial thought focus on how biopolitical assumptions could be applied within philological disciplines, the idea of a 'hard' anthropological nucleus and a 'soft' textual culture referring to it needs to be revised. Because of their methodological potential and cultural strength, European philologies were scientific models up to the second half of the 19th century and relied on the same epistemic assumptions from which 'modern' raciological discourses were born. This comes mainly from the relation established since the 17th century between the variety of languages, scripts and textual cultures on the one hand, and rationality on the other. The arguments that stem from this discourse of a challenged universalism were amalgamated with genealogical thought in 19th century philology and an obsession with origins as the biblical narrative faded away. Thus, spiritual or cognitive forms, understood as determining factors in historical evolution, could then be linked to an assumed 'original' intellectual or anthropological potentiality. However, raciological conceptualizations have been far from being without alternative. My paper argues that if the return to philology aims to be more than a reaction to the normative loss of textual culture, then the epistemological struggle within the history of philology needs to be reflected in its relevance for any 'future' philology.","[Messling, Markus] Ctr Marc Bloch Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"Messling, M (corresponding author), Ctr Marc Bloch Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",messling@cmb.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,74,2,2,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",2451-9189,2451-9197,,PHILOLOG ENCOUNTERS,Philol.

This article reviews research on Black student mathematics participation at the pre-college, post-secondary, and professional levels. Three systemic barriers to Black student participation are limited access, limiting mindsets and beliefs, and lack of support. Eliminating these barriers can result in an increase in Black students' enrollment, persistence, and achievement in advanced mathematics courses. The article provides strategies proven successful in urban contexts to ensure equitable learning environments that maximize the full potential of Black students.

This existent relationship will be displayed from an anthropological perspective, based on the Cultural Materialism, Theory by Marvin Harris and the general, Theory of Conflicts by Johan Galtung, at the same time as looking for a nexus with the approaches of Francisco Jimenez, which leads cultural materialism towards an anthropology for peace. This investigation of scientific character, is based on diagnostics, prognostics and therapy of the pathologies derived from the new postmodern society. The fictionalization which subjugates the society, stemming from Biopolitics and Biopower or excessive use of symbolic, direct, or structural power, leads towards a shared nihilism, which presents a multi-pathological diagnosis which forms a diffuse and hostile social fabric, where racism reveals itself in a subtle way. In reference to this, what we propose as a possible solution of the multidimensional conflict of racism, within the scope of the general theory of conflicts and peace studies, is the eradication of the violence through the application of the Neutral Peace, Theory, which is developed and promoted by Francisco Jimenez, in the diverse contexts where the germ of discriminatory racism makes itself visible.","[Moldes Anaya, Sergio] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Anaya, SM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.",sergiomoldesanaya@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,1,"UNIV GRANADA, INST PAZ CONFLICTOS",GRANADA,"CALLE RECTOR LOPEZ ARGUETA S/N, GRANADA, 18071, SPAIN",1988-7221,,,REV PAZ CONFL,Rev.

The personal stories reported in this study are a direct challenge to the dominant political narrative that Scotland does not have a racism problem. When faced with this discord between narrative and reality, young adult migrants in Scotland must negotiate both their own lived experiences and biographical narratives to achieve a sense of security. A narrative enquiry methodology is used to explore mundane and everyday interactions for four young adult migrants who have settled in Glasgow over the last 10 years. These accounts of daily life offer a unique view into the everyday racism and racial microaggressions faced by this group. Additionally, the opinions of selected Scottish politicians have been collected to gather an additional viewpoint on racism in Scotland. A theoretical perspective stemming from ontological security theory contributes to the racial microaggressions literature in unpacking how individual migrants negotiate traumatic experiences of racism and manage their identities. The analysis explores how migrant individuals may employ coping mechanisms and adopt distinct behaviours to minimise the daily trauma of racism and microaggressions experienced in Scotland. This study, therefore, highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research on racism, narrative, and security studies, and the opportunities for bringing together these distinct perspectives.","[Nicolson, Marcus] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Econ & Law, Glasgow, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Nicolson, M (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Econ & Law, Glasgow, Scotland.",marcus.nicolson@gcu.ac.uk,,"Nicolson, Marcus/0000-0003-2593-7927","Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund (AMIF) [821619]","Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund (AMIF)","The article is the result of research and data col-lected under the project VOLPOWER (Volunteer and Empower: Enhancing Community Building and Social Integration through Dialogue and Collaboration amongst Young Europeans and Third Country Nationals) (821619) funded by the Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund (AMIF) .

However, research specific to STEM pedagogical practices (e.g., curricular design, classroom instruction, student support) is missing from this literature, which can provide discipline-specific insights on affirming classroom practices for this population. Reform in undergraduate STEM curriculum and instruction has largely focused on supporting all students, which upholds the guise of neutrality while leaving unchallenged the interlocking functions of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy. As a response to the JWM themed issue's call for reimagining STEM higher education research, this position paper proposes a queer of color research agenda to generate alternative approaches for undergraduate pedagogy that disrupt the violence of neutrality in STEM. Our agenda makes a twofold contribution. First, we extend research on racism and misogyny in undergraduate STEM classrooms by exploring how cisheteropatriarchy informs variation in racially minoritized students'experiences of pedagogical practices when considering minoritized gender and sexual identities. Second, the agenda brings a focus on STEM pedagogy to research on QTSOC, which has been overlooked despite its impact on students' academic persistence and disciplinary identity constructions. The position paper concludes with implications for departmental faculty, college/university leaders, and federal agencies to assist the development of educational practice and policies that disrupt STEM neutrality responsible for marginalization among undergraduate QTSOC.","[Leyva, Luis A.; McNeill, R.

This paper considers study findings that generate potential clinical social work strategies that are particularly relevant for communities of color experiencing ethno-racial trauma. The purpose of this paper is to support clinical practitioners' efforts to use holistic approaches and practices by incorporating the bio component of the biopsychosocial paradigm as it relates to racism. There are at least three pathways by which racism may produce neurobiological consequences that affect the biopsychosocial functioning of populations of color: (a) socio-structural/environmental, (b) stress and/or trauma, and (c) epigenetics. The Flint, Michigan water crisis-wherein the local government allowed lead to contaminate the city's drinking water causing negative health (brain and body) consequences for Flint residents, a predominantly Black and Brown community-presents an example of the intersecting pathways and autopoietic nature of racism that infects relationships, institutions and systems; causes dehumanizing affects; and produces ill effects as evidenced by racial health inequities. The issues, such as racial health inequities, that social workers struggle to resolve tend to be complex and multi-dimensional. Therefore, comprehensive practice is needed to support healthy biopsychosocial functioning. As such, this paper offers Critical Clinical Social Work Practice (CCSWP) informed by the Critical Transformative Potential Development (CTPD) framework. CTPD centers a trauma-informed and healing-centered approach to CCSWP by transforming consciousness into action to change self, relationships, and environment; ideally, working cyclically from the molecular to the macro. Given the field's enduring commitment to social justice, the biopsychosocial model, and the person-in-environment perspective, social work is in a unique position to critically consider how brain health (bio) is affected by trauma (psycho) stemming from racism (social). These multi-level (molecular to macro) considerations empower clinical social workers to innovate integrated strategies that can overcome complex challenges perpetuating racial health inequities.","[Jemal, Alexis] Hunter Coll, Silberman Sch Social Work, 2180 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10035 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Jemal, A (corresponding author), Hunter Coll, Silberman Sch Social Work, 2180 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10035 USA.",AJ1423@hunter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,98,4,4,2,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0091-1674,1573-3343,,CLIN SOC WORK J,Clin.

It also contributes to a lack of diversity in science communication, the types of science stories that are told, and the communities science communicators seek to engage. Racism is omnipresent in STEM, from education to research to science communication (SciComm), because STEM institutions operate within a culture systematically privileging Whiteness, i.e., a White supremacy culture (WSC), that dictates the norms and practices that most in these fields heedlessly accept and replicate. In this Perspective, we acknowledge the ways in which SciComm and SciComm training perpetuate WSC and examine how SciComm trainers can use their power to dismantle it. SciComm trainers pioneer new methods of sharing ideas and influence the culture of STEM, so are uniquely situated to bring about systemic change to address these problems in SciComm, STEM, and society, starting with four core themes for action: (1) Authentic Interrogation, Acknowledgment, and Accountability; (2) Representation; (3) Culturally Responsive Practice; and (4) Inclusion. We also describe our current work, which builds upon the Key Traits of Inclusive SciComm identified by leaders in the field, to co-create a framework to guide authentic, culturally competent, and inclusive SciComm. The draft framework integrates the Key Traits across spheres of influence (e.g., self, interpersonal, community, institution, society: politics and culture), with the ultimate goal of using SciComm to supplant WSC across these spheres of influence, with new cocreated norms centering minoritized scholars, science communicators, and audiences in STEM.","[Callwood, Karlisa A.

It first traces Butler's uses of Fanon's thinking across her work, outlining the different ways that she draws on Fanon in theorizing race and racism. The article then shows how that theorizing stems from Butler's reading of the historico-racial schema, focusing on her insertion of words that do not appear in either the translation she cites or in the original French text into a key quotation. This article argues that this systematic misreading of the historico-racial schema in Black Skin, White Masks problematically restricts Butler's understanding of the lasting effects and ethical consequences of racism and colonialism as they appear in her readings of that text and of The Wretched of the Earth.","[Ewara, Eyo] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Ewara, E (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,,17,2,4,0,0,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",2165-8684,2165-8692,,CRIT PHILOS RACE,Crit.

The major part of his political and cultural articles were published in the Romanian language magazines Free World, Agora, Limits, Meridian, Ethos, and in the international magazines Panorama, Mondoperaio and Nouvelle Acropole while the scientific studies were published in international journals such as Aevum, Dialogue, Neophilologus. In the political articles, Culianu tried to analyze the concepts of totalitarianism, communism, and racism and its origins as well as the individual's right to resources and power and where that claim could become illegal and dangerous for the others. In this regard, the column The Racist Offence, original title L'offense raciste is an historical argumentative discourse in which Culianu analyzes the racism origins in the international context. The article was published in January 1985 in the French magazine Nouvelle Acropole. Culianu absolutely acknowledges himself as a convinced anti-racist right from the beginning and claims he is a total supporter of the democratic system as the ideal option for the most functional modern society. Culture, religion and politics are subtly connected in nowadays society as the racist attitude is generated by wrong beliefs, ethereal ideas and massive intolerance. Racism is a phenomenon explained as having its origins in prejudices and preconceptions, it stems from theinability to accept equal rights and mutual understanding, arrogance, perfidy and the lack of respect for the human being.","Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Listes Pop, AD (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,ARHIPELAG XXI PRESS,TARGU-MURES,"STRADA MOLDOVEI, NR 8, TARGU-MURES, MURES 540519, ROMANIA",,,978-606-93590-3-7,,,,2013,,,,,,,214,223,,,,,,10,Literary Theory & Criticism,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Literature,BC3YK,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000352085100026,View Full Record in Web of Science

This transformation cannot be achieved through typical top-down, short-term approaches to school improvement or professional development. In this article we explain how, in an urban school district working to bring Digital Literacy and Computer Science (DLCS) to all students, robust professional learning communities (PLCs) have been leveraged to redress racism and led to changes in teacher mind-sets, more equitable classroom practices, and positive social-emotional learning outcomes. We explain how routine school improvement initiatives, such as stand-alone professional development events, fail to address racist beliefs and behaviors, and are inadequate to the task of advancing SEL. We describe the attributes and outcomes of effective PLCs, including the effects that PLC participation may have on teacher capacity to make anti-racist changes to curriculum and instruction, and advance the social, emotional, and academic learning of all students.","[Leonard, Ann M.] Cent Berkshire Reg Sch Dist, Craneville Elementary Sch, Dalton, MA 01226 USA; [Woodland, Rebecca H.] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Educ, Dept Educ Policy Res & Adm, Amherst, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Leonard, AM (corresponding author), Cent Berkshire Reg Sch Dist, Craneville Elementary Sch, Dalton, MA 01226 USA.",aleonard@umass.edu,"Woodland, Rebecca/JFK-7176-2023",,National Science Foundation [1837086]; Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1837086] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DRL 1837086.

Drawing from multimethod research conducted in collaboration with Enxet and Sanapana communities in Paraguay, I evaluate how waterscape change produces social vulnerability with a focus on Indigenous access to safe drinking water. Stemming from a seemingly simple question-how have annual flood and drought events in the Chaco become malignant for Enxet and Sanapana peoples-my analysis centers on current struggles for Indigenous rights amidst Paraguay's booming ranching industry. I use an eclectic data set-from historical missionary accounts, seventy-two household questionnaires, mapping new waterscapes, and a political economy of cattle ranching-to show how settler waterscapes produce environmental racism by limiting Indigenous access to good water. I argue that the prevalence of water scarcity in Indigenous communities across the Bajo Chaco is not a natural result of biophysical geography but a socially produced outcome of how settler waterscapes rework hydrosocial relations along racial lines. CPG offers a way to bridge biophysical analysis with critical social theory to expand geographic understandings of settler colonialism and its effects on Indigenous environmental justice.","[Correia, Joel E.] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Correia, JE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",joel.correia@latam.ufl.edu,,"Correia, Joel/0000-0002-1679-4381",,,,,112,10,10,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2469-4452,2469-4460,,ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR,Ann.

Results indicate that, while both everyday and major discrimination are negatively associated with sense of purpose, only everyday discrimination remains significant when included in the same model. Additionally, race moderates these associations, whereby Black adults show less negative relationships than White adults.

In his view, there can be no more substantive debate about the justification of speciesism thanthere can be about the legality of murder, for it stems from the definition of speciesism that speciesism is unjustified just as it stems from the definition of murder that murder is illegal. The present paper is a case against this conception. I distinguish two issues: one is descriptive (Is speciesism wrong by definition?) and the other normative (Should speciesismbe wrong by definition?). Relying on philosophers' use of the term, I first answer the descriptive question negatively: speciesism is a purely descriptive concept. Then, based onboth its main functions in the philosophical and public debates and an analogy with racism, I answer the normative question negatively: speciesism should remain a purely descriptive concept.

Despite the intransigent connection between race and STEM doctoral outcomes, US STEM education policy documents typically fail to identify racism as influencing this racial inequity. This paper presents critical capital theory (CCT)-an integration of critical race theory, forms of capital, and fictive kinship-to give racism full explanatory power within the context of US STEM doctoral outcomes. CCT proposes that access to large and affluent social networks containing supportive individuals who have knowledge of how to successfully navigate institutions of power is currently core to STEM doctoral success. This access reinforces STEM identity and belonging, but has been and continues to be primarily preserved for White students via an ever-evolving system of racism. CCT proposes systems supporting STEM faculty's consistent provision of high-quality mentorship experiences for all their students-coupled with accountability for providing this mentorship-would result in more equitable STEM doctoral outcomes.","[Bancroft, Senetta F.] Southern Illinois Univ, 625 Wham Dr,Mail Code 4610, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Bancroft, SF (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, 625 Wham Dr,Mail Code 4610, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",senetta.bancroft@siu.edu,,"Bancroft, Senetta/0000-0002-7498-1169",,,,,111,11,22,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-8326,1098-237X,,SCI EDUC,Sci.

However, Baez argued that DEI service can also be a form of agentic resistance through which faculty rebuild more equitable universities. Previous framings, focused on outcomes of DEI service have obscured the fact that most of the work in DEI in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is being done by faculty who are themselves from historically excluded groups. Understanding DEI work as both a burden and a form of critical agency, I argue in this paper that we need to reframe DEI service in STEM as a type of institutional activism. After defining institutional activism, I introduce a DEI institutional activism framework based on the theory of collective iden-tity, which has previously been used to frame identity-based activism. I then describe four research trajectories that can be explored under this framework: (a) cognitive definitions of the means, aims, and environment of activist work; (b) the role of activist networks; (c) the impact of emotional in-vestment; and (d) the impact of social identity on engagement. Finally, I identify potential fruitful research questions that could be investigated under this framing and discuss how power dynamics impact this space.","[Jauchen, Joanna G.] George Mason Univ, Dept Math Sci, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 3F2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Jauchen, JG (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Math Sci, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 3F2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jjauchen@gmu.edu,,,,,,,86,0,0,1,1,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1072-8325,1940-431X,,J WOMEN MINOR SCI EN,J.

Their use of race-neutral, colorblind language (avoiding racial terms but implying them) allowed White faculty members to describe their students as academically inferior, less prepared, and less interested in pursuing research and graduate studies while potentially ignoring structural causes.

The ability of risk prediction models to produce estimates that are valid and reliable for people from diverse socio-demographic backgrounds-and consequently their utility for broadening the reach of precision medicine to marginalized populations-depends on ensuring that the risk factors included in the model are represented as thoroughly and as accurately as possible. However, cancer risk prediction models created in the United States have a critical limitation, the origins of which stem from the country's earliest days: they either erroneously treat the social construct of race as an immutable biological factor (ie, they essentialize race), or they exclude from the model those socio-contextual factors that are associated with both race and health outcomes. Models that essentialize race and/or exclude socio-contextual factors sometimes incorporate race corrections that adjust a patient's risk estimate up or down based on their race. This commentary discusses the origins of race corrections, potential flaws with such corrections, and strategies for developing cohorts for developing risk prediction models that do not essentialize race or exclude key socio-contextual factors. Such models will help move the science of cancer prevention and control towards its goal of eliminating cancer disparities and achieving health equity.","[Waters, Erika A.; Colditz, Graham A.; Davis, Kia L.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Campus Box 8100,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA",Washington University (WUSTL),"Waters, EA (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Campus Box 8100,660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",waterse@wustl.edu,"Colditz, Graham A/A-3963-2009","Colditz, Graham A/0000-0002-7307-0291; Davis, Kia L./0000-0002-1338-3018; Waters, Erika/0000-0001-7402-0133","National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [R01CA190391, P30CA091842]; Washington University Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health [UL1TR002345]; Foundation for Barnes Jewish Hospital; Breast Cancer Research Foundation",National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Washington University Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health; Foundation for Barnes Jewish Hospital; Breast Cancer Research Foundation,"This work was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (Grant numbers: R01CA190391; P30CA091842).

The lead character, as well as the supporting cast of toy characters, represents a variety of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities while modeling medicine and healthcare practices. A critical race sociological perspective recognizes that, in the U.S., racism and social stratification are endemic and this practice of culturally characterizing the toys is situated within a larger historical and sociopolitical context where different cultures, identities, and communities experience differences in power, privilege, and oppression. At times, toys were representative of communities that have historically endured oppression, e.g. communities of color, immigrant communities, and communities with low-income status. Furthermore, in the show, the doctor diagnoses and responds to medical challenges faced by the toy characters and these medical challenges were, at times, caused or exacerbated by the behavior or disposition of some of the toys themselves. Thus, toys were also variably characterized as exhibiting problematic healthcare behavior, while some toys exhibited positive healthcare behavior. Healthcare behavior was similarly located within an ideological context which has associated communities of color, especially those with low-income status, with irresponsible, self-destructive behavior and dependency, as well as an overburdened welfare state. Of concern was the intersection, especially disproportionately, of problematic healthcare behavior and toys representative of communities that have endured these and other related negative characterizations. Through counter-storytelling, the dominant narrative of the television show foregrounded in diversity is complicated to trace adaptive and resilient racial ideologies into new settings and structures. The ideological underpinnings and limitations of diversity itself in our current sociopolitical context are utilized to further examine the phenomenon within the television show.","[Mark, Sheron L.] Univ Louisville, Coll Educ & Human Dev, 1905 S1st St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Louisville,"Mark, SL (corresponding author), Univ Louisville, Coll Educ & Human Dev, 1905 S1st St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",sheron.mark@louisville.edu,,,,,,,45,2,2,2,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1871-1502,1871-1510,,CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT,Cult.

The project compares the experiences of students currently majoring in science (N = 304) with the experiences of those who have succeeded in earning science degrees (N = 307). Participants were surveyed about their pipeline experiences based on theories that are commonly used to explain matriculation issues. The results of the study revealed that although both groups recognized the major role of race in their experiences, the primary factor distinguishing between students and professionals was their sense of Alignment with their respective community and their different experiences with subtle forms of racism (Microaggressions). African-American scientists were far more likely to report a weak sense of belonging to their community and were far more likely to report subtle encounters with racism. By contrast, African-American science students were more likely to feel comfortable with the science community and less likely to report subtle racist encounters. The findings of this study are indicative of the pervasive impact of racial bias and conflict as a gatekeeper in providing access to science careers.

The American Psychological Association, along with many professional organizations across the subfields of psychology, has released its statement outlining how psychology must contribute to the eradication of systemic racism and white supremacy. In this article, we address the need for psychology and its subfields to acknowledge our complicity in certain systems of oppression, such as our ties to law enforcement and the police, our support of mental health reforms that merely increase the scope of a punitive criminal justice system, and our complicity in the harm done by our current immigration policies. We argue that the best way, in fact the only way, for the profession to move toward an antiracist psychological practice is to embrace an abolitionist framework so that we may reimagine our relationships with historically oppressive institutions and rebuild our clinical practices to promote life-affirming interventions and liberation for individuals and communities.","[Klukoff, Hannah; Kanani, Haleh; Gaglione, Claire] Univ Denver, Denver, CO USA; [Alexander, Apryl] Univ Denver, Grad Sch Profess Psychol, 2450 South Vine St, Denver, CO 80210 USA",University of Denver; University of Denver,"Klukoff, H (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Grad Sch Profess Psychol, 2450 South Vine St, Denver, CO 80210 USA.",HKlukoff1@gmail.com,"Alexander, Apryl/GZM-1388-2022","Alexander, Apryl/0000-0002-9666-9598; Klukoff, Hannah/0000-0002-5364-9597; Gaglione, Claire/0000-0002-3544-4352",,,,,54,7,10,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-1678,1552-650X,,J HUMANIST PSYCHOL,J.

This reflects an emergent form of racialization in the Global South and a facet of new racism often overlooked within existing theorizations of race and racism that stems from Global North contexts. Drawing from urban ethnographic research, this paper provides a spatial analysis of the racialization of Northeastern migrants in Delhi. First, it examines the structural racialization of Northeasterns induced by Delhi's neoliberal urbanism that constructs them as the city's service providers. Second, it explores their self-racialization through co-constitutive race-making and place-making practices in a distinct socio-spatial formation - the urban village. Finally, it argues that through racial-spatial processes, the Northeastern emerges as a new racialized urban identity; thereby linking racialization, spatialization, and identity formation in a postcolonial, globalizing, Global South city.","[Rai, Rohini] Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England",Brunel University,"Rai, R (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England.",Rohini.Rai@brunel.ac.uk,,"Rai, Rohini/0000-0001-5068-6539",,,,,72,0,0,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-9870,1466-4356,,ETHNIC RACIAL STUD,Ethn.

Previous research proposed that the reason for these pairings stems from White Americans' racial preferences, such that White men prefer Asian women over Black women (i.e., the group stereotyped as more feminine), whereas White women prefer Black men over Asian men (i.e., the group stereotyped as more masculine). Here, we argue that focusing solely on White Americans' preferences neglects the reality that Americans of color also have preferences (and beliefs about others' preferences) that contribute to the composition of U.S. interracial relationships. Method: We used multiple methodologies (i.e., surveys and experimental manipulations) to examine Asian, Black, and White Americans beliefs about others' preferences. Results: Across three studies (N = 3,728), we reveal that Asian, Black, and White Americans have beliefs about others' preferences (Study 1), that those beliefs mirror their own preferences (Study 2), and that those beliefs have causal implications for their own preferences (Study 3). Conclusion: Collectively, these findings reveal that such beliefs (and preferences) advantage White Americans, such that both Asian and Black Americans believe that they are more attractive to White Americans than to each other, which leads them to be more attracted to White Americans. Public Significance Statement In the United States, the two most common interracial relationships are between Asian women and White men, and between Black men and White women. Previous research has pointed to racial group proximity, racial gender stereotypes, status, and White American preferences to explain these patterns in interracial marriages, but little to no research has examined Asian and Black Americans beliefs in shaping these patterns. The present research emphasizes the perspectives of Asian and Black Americans to highlight how cognitive processes (i.e., beliefs about others' beliefs) interact with social identities (i.e., beliefs about others' beliefs among Asian, Black, and White Americans) to produce social dynamics, and how even our most intimate and seemingly progressive relationships are not immune to systemic racism.","[Auelua-Toomey, Sakaria Laisene; Roberts, Steven Othello] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Bldg 420,450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Roberts, Steven Othello] Stanford Univ, Ctr Study Comparat Study Race & Ethn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Auelua-Toomey, SL; Roberts, SO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Bldg 420,450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",sakaria4@stanford.edu; sothello@stanford.edu,,"Auelua-Toomey, Sakaria/0000-0003-0067-7057",,,,,68,3,3,3,4,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1099-9809,1939-0106,,CULT DIVERS ETHN MIN,Cult.

This study aims to compare individual experiences of microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations with institutional responses, thereby outlining the disconnects between the perspectives of minoritized scientists and those in positions of power. This paper draws on a constructivist paradigm to compare the experiences of women of color scientists with organizational representatives through 31 interviews conducted in science research organizations in the United Kingdom. The results find that organizational understandings of microaggressions differ substantially from those of WOC scientists. Furthermore, organizational responses favor policy-based solutions that fail to address the slippery and deniable nature of microaggressions. The paper concludes that, contrary to the more prevalent popular diversity initiatives, a greater belief in the testimony of WOC scientists amplified by institutional responses that empower their identity as scientists would be more effective strategies to reduce the sense of shame and isolation caused by subtle forms of discrimination.","[Salmon, Udeni] Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, Bristol, England; [Salmon, Udeni] Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, 8 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TZ, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Salmon, U (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Policy Studies, 8 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TZ, England.",udeni.salmon@bristol.ac.uk,,"Wijayasiri, Udeni/0000-0003-3448-1642",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/S012001/1]; EPSRC [EP/S012001/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Number: EP/S012001/1",,66,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-6673,1468-0432,,GENDER WORK ORGAN,Gend.

Furthermore, systemic minoritization has resulted in a dearth of Black STEM faculty that can help Black STEM students navigate racially hostile academic climates. As a result, Black students may have to rely on non-Black faculty for support and allyship, which is concerning given reports of inappropriate behaviors and common pitfalls perpetrated by aspiring allies. Surprisingly, few studies have examined Black students' perspectives toward faculty allies and appropriate ally behaviors, which limit the effectiveness of aspiring faculty allies. Therefore, this study used semistructured interviews to investigate Black STEM graduate students' perspectives about faculty ally behaviors. Three categories emerged-prepare to be an ally, foster credibility, and practice active allyship. In addition, the three categories informed the preliminary design of the multidimensional axis of allyship development framework, which contributes to how allyship development is conceptualized and offers practical insights for research, Black students, and aspiring faculty allies.","[Stone-Sabali, Steven; Mills, Kristen J.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Educ Studies, Columbus, OH USA; [Mallory, Allen B.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH USA; [Alexander, E.] Univ Kansas, Sch Social Welf, Lawrence, KS USA; [Stone-Sabali, Steven] Ohio State Univ, Dept Educ Studies, 305 Annie & John Glenn Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Kansas; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Stone-Sabali, S (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Educ Studies, 305 Annie & John Glenn Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",stone-sabali.1@osu.edu,"Mallory, Allen/GLN-2970-2022; Mills, Kristen J/HJY-9279-2023","Mallory, Allen/0000-0003-1392-9735; Mills, Kristen J/0000-0002-5014-9685",,,,,75,0,0,1,1,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1938-8926,1938-8934,,J DIVERS HIGH EDUC,J.

Because racial disparities are known to affect outcome in hematologic malignancies, the authors sought to explore disparities among patients with TP53-mutated AML. MethodsA multicenter, retrospective study was conducted in a cohort of 340 patients who had TP53-mutated AML (275 non-Hispanic White [NHW] and 65 non-Hispanic Black [NHB]) to analyze differences in treatment and outcome among NHW and NHB patients. ResultsThe median patient age was comparable between NHW and NHB patients (p = .76). A higher proportion of NHB patients had therapy-related AML (31% vs. 20%; p = .08) and had co-mutations (74% vs. 61%; p = .06). A higher proportion of NHW patients received intensive chemotherapy compared with NHB patients (47% vs. 31%; p = .02). Conversely, a higher proportion of NHB patients received low-intensity chemotherapy (9% vs. 5.5%; p = .02) or best supportive care (22% vs. 7%; p < .001). The complete response rate (including complete responses with or without complete count recovery) was 31% versus 24.5% (p = .39) in NHW and NHB patients, respectively. Only 5% of NHB patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared with 15.5% of NHW patients (p = .02). The proportion of patients who were event-free (18.5% vs. 8.5%; p = .49) or who remained alive (24.9% vs. 8.3%; p = .13) at 18 months was numerically higher in NHW versus NHB patients, respectively, but was not statistically significant. ConclusionsThe current study highlights disparities between NHW and NHB patients with TP53-mutated AML. Efforts are warranted to eliminate treatment disparities in minority populations.","[Badar, Talha; Correia, Guilherme Sacchi De Camargo] Mayo Clin, Div Hematol & Med Oncol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Litzow, Mark R.; Saliba, Antoine N.; Al Kali, Aref] Mayo Clin, Div Hematol, Rochester, MN USA; [Shallis, Rory M.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Hematol, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Patel, Anand; Stahl, Maximilian; Duvall, Adam] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Hematol & Oncol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Burkart, Madelyn; Abaza, Yasmin; Dinner, Shira] Northwestern Hosp, Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL USA; [Bewersdorf, Jan P.; Goldberg, Aaron D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Hematol Malignancies, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Murthy, Guru Subramanian Guru] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Hematol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bradshaw, Danielle; Kota, Vamsi] Georgia Canc Ctr, Div Hematol & Med Oncol, Augusta, GA USA; [Palmisiano, Neil] Jefferson Univ Hosp, Div Hematol & Oncol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Atallah, Ehab] Med Coll Wisconsin, Div Hematol & Med Oncol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA",Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic; Yale University; University of Chicago; Robert H.

In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students' attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based mechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses taught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups representing educational debts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in calculus-based courses, tended to have more expertlike attitudes than any other group of students. Instruction that addresses society's educational debts can help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.","[Nissen, Jayson M.] Nissen Educ Res & Design, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Horses, Ian Her Many] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Ben Van Dusen] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Sci Educ, Chico, CA 95929 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; California State University System; California State University Chico,"Nissen, JM (corresponding author), Nissen Educ Res & Design, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",,"Van Dusen, Ben/CAI-1341-2022","Van Dusen, Ben/0000-0003-1264-0550",NSFIUSE Grant [DUE-1525338]; NSF-HSI Grant [DUE-1928596],NSFIUSE Grant; NSF-HSI Grant,We are grateful to the Learning Assistant Program at the University of Colorado Boulder for establishing the LASSO platform.

We discuss how researchers and educational practitioners should more critically approach STEM equity analyses and why modifying our approaches matters for STEM equity goals. Engaging with equity as a process rather than a static goal, we provide a primer of reflective questions to assist researchers with framing, analysis, and interpretation of student-level data frequently used to identify disparities and assess course-level and programmatic interventions.

Despite decades of concerted effort to broaden participation in engineering, representation continues to lack. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide education researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of barriers to the participation of Black American children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our interest is driven by the role that precollege STEM experiences play in children's likelihood of becoming potential engineering students. Scope/Method We conducted a systematic literature review of 41 articles focused on Black children in precollege STEM contexts. Each article underwent individual review to gain deeper insight into key contextual factors that enable and constrain these potential engineers. Results We situate our research findings in Perna's college choice model to highlight the key factors that may influence one's career and college decisions. The contextual factors are associated with the (1) social, economic, and policy context (e.g., racism, sexism, and classism); (2) STEM educational and community context (i.e., social perceptions and access); and (3) the local support context (i.e., teachers and family). Conclusions Our results represent the early workings of a glass ceiling above the heads of potential engineering students. The underrepresentation of Black Americans who thrive in engineering is a byproduct of the lack of accessibility to quality and advanced learning experiences that too often plague K-12 schools and communities that serve high populations of Black Americans.

However, finding ways to leverage heterogeneity toward disciplinary teaching is a formidable challenge and teachers can benefit from targeted support to recognize heterogeneity in STEM, and its relationship to race and racism in disciplinary teaching. These data draw from a nine-day professional development seminar for secondary teachers to promote heterogeneity in STEM learning (n = 12). Drawing on analyses of lesson plans developed by teachers during the seminar, and subsequent video analyses of small group discussions, we present a case of four teachers debating heterogeneity in science. The exchange is significant because it draws into relief the ideological and emotional terrain of disturbing the racial hierarchy in which Western Modern Science (WMS) is steeped, and its implications for the education of racially minoritized youth. In the focus interaction, a dynamic emerged where three teachers exalted WMS, while the fourth grappled with how cultural heterogeneity has or could matter to her science teaching. Drawing on the constructs of racial-ideological micro-contestation and racial microaggressions, this analysis illustrates three important dimensions to the design of professional learning for STEM teachers that center race: (1) how discipline-specific discussions can uniquely surface the latent racial and ideological meanings teachers associate with STEM; (2) the centrality of teachers' storied knowledge in grappling with heterogeneity; and (3) the interplay of micro-contestation and microaggressions in understanding and anticipating the experiences of minoritized teachers when debating issues of race, disciplinarity, and teaching.","[Sengupta-Irving, Tesha] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tunney, Jessica] TLC Charter Publ Sch, Orange, CA USA; [Macias, Meghan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Gevirtz Grad Sch Educ, Santa Barbara, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Sengupta-Irving, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 2121 Berkeley Way, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",tsi@berkeley.edu,,"Sengupta-Irving, Tesha/0000-0001-6488-5846",,,,,51,5,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0737-0008,1532-690X,,COGNITION INSTRUCT,Cogn.

I use social comparison and relative deprivation, a subsidiary theory of social comparison, as guiding theoretical frameworks. Since the intersections of race and gender are salient, I also incorporate an intersectional framework as an analytical tool. Through data derived from semi-structured interviews, I find that, when describing graduate-school experiences, Black engineering and computer science respondents use social comparisons with regard to race, gender, and their intersections to juxtapose their experiences with those of their peers. Participants described feeling relatively deprived due to inequities resulting from racism and/or sexism and primarily felt that STEM privileged students that were Asian men. Nevertheless, Black men described downward social comparisons with their Black female counterparts, recognizing the sexist culture of STEM. Overall, however, social comparison processes led Black respondents to identify inequities within their Ph.D. programs in engineering and computer science that made them feel as though STEM was not intended for them, but, rather, for their Asian and white male peers who are positioned as belonging.","[Brockman, Amanda J.] Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Brockman, AJ (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",amanda.j.brockman@vanderbilt.edu,"Brockman, Amanda/AHB-1482-2022","Brockman, Amanda/0000-0003-4512-2143",,,,,82,9,12,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-0245,1475-682X,,SOCIOL INQ,Sociol.

Until recently, concerns about this ethnicity degree awarding gap have not received the research attention it deserves. In this paper, we contribute to this gap in knowledge with a focus on how students make sense of the difference in degree outcomes by ethnicity. Informed by 69 in-depth interviews with minority and majority ethnic students at a UK university, we explore their views towards the ethnicity degree awarding gap, why it exists and what would be their solution to reduce this difference. Although some students perceived the awarding gap as a reflection of individual aptitude, others have attributed social barriers for degree outcome differences. We present five recommendations as suggested by students for policy and practice. Firstly, the provision of greater economic support for minority ethnic students, which will improve access and a more diverse student population. Secondly, to establish an institutional commitment to challenge and eradicate all forms of racism on campus, including microaggressions. Thirdly, to increase representation of minority ethnic staff and students in higher education to improve students' sense of belongings and aspirations, with the emphasis on greater staff diversity. Fourthly, to diversify the curriculum with a wider range of values and perspectives incorporated into teaching. Finally, universities need to be proactive and reflective to ensure structural barriers are reduced or eliminated through additional support or alternative provisions.","[Wong, Billy; ElMorally, Reham; Copsey-Blake, Meggie] Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Wong, B (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Reading RG1 5EX, Berks, England.",b.wong@reading.ac.uk,"Wong, Billy/X-1769-2019","Wong, Billy/0000-0002-7310-6418",University of Reading,University of Reading,This work was supported by the University of Reading.,,88,7,7,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-877X,1469-9486,,J FURTH HIGHER EDUC,J.

We share reflexive narratives called testimonios to describe our experiences as women of color in academia, in the hopes of encouraging reflection, developing insight, cultivating compassion, and inciting social justice action amongst our readers.

In 2019, Papuans protested against entrenched racism in Indonesian society, when Papuan students in Java were subjected to racist epithets. Since then, Papuans have used the hashtag #Papuanlivesmatter to articulate their connection with broader antiracism protests across the world and bring the Papuan experience to #BlackLivesMatter movements. While global Black political movements have long shaped Papuan identities, the new Papuan Lives Matter movement shows how digital media have played an influential role in the spread of antiracism protests and how Blackness has been understood and articulated, not only in relation to white supremacy but also to postcolonial claims of multiculturalism in Asian societies. This article discusses the specific context in which protests under Papuan Lives Matter emerged and its relationship with the global Black Lives Matter movements.

Their recruitment and retention become more challenging in light of research findings on work life for postsecondary faculty. Research has shown that postsecondary faculty members in general have become increasingly stressed and job satisfaction has declined with dissatisfaction with endeavors and work overload cited as major stressors. In addition to the stresses managed by higher education faculty at large, Black faculty must navigate diversity-related challenges. Illuminating and understanding their experiences can be instrumental in lessening stress and job dissatisfaction, outcomes that facilitate recruitment and retention. This study featured the experiences and perceptions of Black faculty in science education. This study, framed by critical race theory, examines two questions: What characterizes the work life of some Black faculty members who teach, research, and serve in science education? How are race and racism present in the experiences of these postsecondary Black faculty members?

Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level.","[Erete, Sheena; Nacu, Denise; Dickinson, Jessa] DePaul Univ, 243 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Thomas, Karla; Thompson, Naomi; Pinkard, Nichole] Northwestern Univ, 633 Clark St, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",DePaul University; Northwestern University,"Erete, S (corresponding author), DePaul Univ, 243 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",serete@depaul.edu; karlathomas2026@u.northwestern.edu; dnacu@depaul.edu; jdickin5@depaul.edu; naomi.thompson@northwestern.edu; nichole.pinkard@northwestern.edu,,"Thompson, Naomi/0000-0002-0278-0616","National Science Foundation [1850505, 1850543, 1952144, 1831685]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1952144, 1831685] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1850543, 1850505] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This material was based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants 1850505, 1850543, 1952144, and 1831685.",,79,15,18,5,12,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1946-6226,,,ACM T COMPUT EDUC,ACM Trans.

An investigation of existing literature reveals the need for greater emphasis on environmental racism and social justice as they pertain to students living in low-income and urban communities.

We define ethno-racial trauma as the individual and/or collective psychological distress and fear of danger that results from experiencing or witnessing discrimination, threats of harm, violence, and intimidation directed at ethno-racial minority groups. This form of trauma stems from a legacy of oppressive laws, policies, and practices. Using an intersectionality framework, this article discusses the complex ways in which interlocking systems of oppression (e.g., racism, ethnocentrism, nativism, sexism) and anti-immigrant policies impact Latinxs individuals, families, and communities. The article also presents a framework to stimulate healing from ethno-racial trauma titled, HEART (Healing Ethno And Racial Trauma). Grounded in the principles of Liberation Psychology and trauma-informed care, the framework is composed of four phases. Each phase is accompanied by a goal to assist clinicians in helping individuals, families, and communities to achieve growth, wellness, and healing. The main objective of each phase is for Latinx immigrants to find relief, gain awareness, and cope with systemic oppression while encouraging resistance and protection from the external forces that cause ethno-racial trauma. Overall, our intention and hopeful expectation is that the content presented in this article serves as a call to action for psychologists to make psychology a Sanctuary Discipline by using and integrating intersectionality theory, trauma-informed care, and Liberation Psychology into policy, research, and practice with Latinx immigrants.","[Chavez-Duenas, Nayeli Y.; Adames, Hector Y.] Chicago Sch Profess Psychol, Dept Counseling Psychol, 325 North Wells St, Chicago, IL 60654 USA; [Perez-Chavez, Jessica G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Counseling Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Salas, Silvia P.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Counseling Psychol, Milwaukee, WI USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Chavez-Dueñas, NY (corresponding author), Chicago Sch Profess Psychol, Dept Counseling Psychol, 325 North Wells St, Chicago, IL 60654 USA.",nchavez@thechicagoschool.edu,,"Adames, Hector/0000-0003-2169-1165",,,,,89,151,224,1,28,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0003-066X,1935-990X,,AM PSYCHOL,Am.

A systematic literature review (N = 68) was conducted to investigate the causes and effects of racial disparities produced by systemic racism in the educational and workforce domains of construction. Particularly, this paper focuses on exploring how racial disparities in construction impact minorities, the current state of the racial divide, the practices that perpetuate racial inequities, and the strategies currently used to prevent, in a sustainable manner, such practices. The results of this systematic literature search revealed that exclusionary practices and ideologies cause an underrepresentation of minorities in construction that directly affects employment and industry representation in the United States. Previous studies show that systemic racism in construction has been supported by meritocracy and colorblindness ideologies, creating an unwelcoming environment where racial minorities have difficulties identifying with the construction domain. Furthermore, systemic racism affects students after graduation from construction programs, as industry trends showcase issues with minorities joining or staying in the field. Although racial disparities caused by systemic racism are an existing issue in the education and workforce domains of construction, there are a rising number of publications that strive to understand how to sustainably increase diversity, equity, and the inclusion of racial minorities. An increasing number of available tools, such as anti-bias and awareness training programs, are being used as a sustainable practice in construction education and in the construction industry to mitigate the effects of systemic racism. Ultimately, this paper's contribution centers on describing the who, how, and what regarding the effect of racial disparities in the construction domain, which reduce the number of minority professionals coming into and staying in the industry.","[Isingizwe, Josiane; Eiris, Ricardo] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geospatial Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Gheisari, Masoud] Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Construction Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Michigan Technological University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Isingizwe, J; Eiris, R (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geospatial Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",jisingiz@mtu.edu; reiris@mtu.edu; masoud@ufl.edu,"Eiris, Ricardo/ABE-6258-2020","Eiris, Ricardo/0000-0001-6904-5352; Gheisari, Masoud/0000-0001-5568-9923; Isingizwe, Josiane/0009-0004-6564-260X",,,,,70,2,4,0,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2023,15,7,,,,,,,5646,10.3390/su15075646,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15075646,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,D6XJ4,,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000970135400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While enjoying the privileges associated with living in families belonging to the racial and ethnic hegemonic group, these children are, at the same time, potentially vulnerable to the kind of discrimination and social stigmatization endured by racial minorities. The data have been extracted from the Adoptive families and their lifestyles survey (2012) and are based on a questionnaire answered by 230 Spanish interracial families who adopted children abroad. The results show how adoptive parents tend to put in practice socialization patterns close to assimilation/acculturation into the mainstream culture, while reproducing at the same time the ideology of colorblind racism.","[Jose Rodriguez-Jaume, Maria] Univ Alicante, Dept Sociol 1, Sociol, Alicante, Spain; [Jose Gonzalez-Rio, Maria] Univ Alicante, Dept Sociol 2, Sociol, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Rodríguez-Jaume, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Sociol 1, Sociol, Alicante, Spain.",mj.rodriguez@ua.es; mj.gonzalez@ua.es,,"Rodriguez-Jaume, Maria-Jose/0000-0002-1668-174X",,,,,39,0,0,3,21,UNIV AUTONOMA ESTADO MEXICO,TOLUCA,"CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, TOLUCA, CP 50100, MEXICO",2448-5799,,,CONVERGENCIA,Convergencia,MAY-AUG,2019,,80,,,,,,,,10.29101/crcs.v26i80.10481,http://dx.doi.org/10.29101/crcs.v26i80.10481,,,25,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,IU1QT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-30,WOS:000483351700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the novels analyzed, Fath al-Andalus (Conquest of Andalusia), Abbasa Ukht al-Rashid (The Caliph's Sister), and al-Amin wa al-Ma'mun (The Caliph's Heirs), Zaydan depicts hierarchies of race that are delineated by certain features and categories, especially within the Abbasid among household slaves, and also centers the conflict within the novels around issues of differences in race and lineage. Zaydan shows the importance of rifts in Islamic history stemming from categorizations and distinctions between Arab and non-Arab, or Arab and Persian, or mawali. The novels also reflect the self-conceptualization of Egyptians in relation to their perceptions of the Sudanese, at a time of the rise of Arab nationalism, in late 19th and early 20th centuries.","[Tasdelen, Esra] Coll Dupage, Dept Languages, Ellyn, IL 60137 USA",,"Tasdelen, E (corresponding author), Coll Dupage, Dept Languages, Ellyn, IL 60137 USA.",tasdelene@cod.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0787,,HUMANITIES-BASEL,Humanities-Basel,DEC,2021,10,4,,,,,,,119,10.3390/h10040119,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/h10040119,,,11,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,YA4PF,,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000738316400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a critical ethnographic approach, I interviewed twenty young people, aged 15-30, to examine their transnational identities and lived experiences in the Canadian context. Arendt's notion of the right to have rights, Isin's concept of acts of citizenship, and Hall's concept of state hegemony proved to be useful theoretical tools to examine the exclusion of refugee youth from the educational market and their statelessness, rightlessness, and statuslessness in the nation-states. The interview data indicate that the statelessness and statuslessness of refugee youth stem from the practices of hegemony, assimilation, and racism by their home and host state. The study also suggests the importance of questioning the state's hegemony and the domination of the western construction of citizenship to provide alternative forms of social and educational participation that can transform the youths' status from refugees to actors and citizens.","[Kayaalp, Dilek] Univ North Florida, Coll Educ & Human Serv, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Kayaalp, D (corresponding author), Univ North Florida, Coll Educ & Human Serv, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",dilek.kayaalp@unf.edu,,,,,,,51,5,6,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1361-3324,1470-109X,,RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK,Race Ethn.

The politics of automobility is a spatial struggle over how the city should be organized and for whom. Yet there is little research on how this struggle is unfolding, and how that politics is shaping urban space. Part of this stems from the essentialization of automobility in policy and academic discourses on cities. Moving beyond essentialization, this article will explore how contentious political struggles reveal nuanced and diverse discourses and ideologies surrounding automobility and space. Focusing on what I call 'secessionist automobility' - using an automobile as an instrument of spatial secession - I examine Atlanta, Georgia's contentious automobility debate. Secessionist automobility is bound with the blunt politics of race-based secession from urban space, but also more subtle forms of spatial secession rooted in anti-urban ideologies. Implications for local, national, and global contestation of automobility will be provided.","San Francisco State Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Henderson, J (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, HSS 279,1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",jhenders@sfsu.edu,"Henderson, Jason/AAG-2497-2019","Henderson, Jason/0000-0003-1431-2921",,,,,54,94,118,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

Guided by theoretical frameworks from Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), a convenience sample of 14 science and mathematics teachers participated in a series of virtual chats using open-ended questioning and facilitated by two university instructors. Using conversation and critical discourse analyses, three primary themes emerged: understanding of issues related to stereotypes, encouragement of females and minorities to pursue careers in STEM, and the place for diversity discussions in science and mathematics classrooms. The teachers felt burdened by curricular and administrative constraints that inhibit their ability to participate in thought-provoking critical conversations. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways teachers can assist in the STEM career identity development of their underrepresented females and students of color and calls for research that combines the key findings in SCCT and CRT to build confidence and capacity for teachers to effectively confront issues of racism, sexism, and stereotyping in science and mathematics classrooms.","[Sparks, David M.; Pole, Kathryn] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Sparks, DM (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",david.sparks@uta.edu,"Zandonade, Viviane/JKI-1817-2023; Pole, Kathryn/AAR-1368-2021","Sparks, David/0000-0002-3496-7290",,,,,64,7,18,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-6803,1949-8594,,SCHOOL SCI MATH,Sch.

We conducted focus groups with graduate students in a School of Education at a predominantly White institution in the South. Our findings support the notion that creating space for doctoral students to engage in race talk (Pollock, M., 2004, Colormute: Race talk dilemmas in an American high school. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press) during their courses is essential for developing racial literacy, or the ability to critically analyze racial/racist ideologies, norms, and patterns embedded in educational policies and practices. We assert that our participants' varied experiences engaging in race talk (i.e., the relative presence of conversations in certain programs and their limited presence in others) may stem from a variety of factors including disciplinary cultures and faculty values and expectations, as well as professional standards advanced by accrediting bodies and organizations. In light of our findings, we conclude that critical conversations about race should be intentionally integrated into doctoral coursework in education. We suggest that colleges/schools of education should increase their efforts to produce racially literate professionals capable of problematizing the constructions of race and racist practices in educational settings.","[Bryan, Michelle L.; Lewis, Ashlee A.; Wills, Lisa E.] Univ S Carolina, Dept Educ Studies, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Wilson, Brandy S.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Leadership & Educ Studies, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Bryan, ML (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Educ Studies, 820 Main St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",mbryan@sc.edu,,"Bryan, Michelle/0009-0001-0665-3163",,,,,63,15,29,1,27,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1938-8926,1938-8934,,J DIVERS HIGH EDUC,J.

Indigenous doulas provide continuous, culturally appropriate support to Indigenous women during pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. This support is critical to counter systemic medical racism and socioeconomic barriers that Indigenous families disproportionately face. This paper analyzes interviews with members of five Indigenous doula collectives to demonstrate their shared challenges, strategies, and missions. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with members of five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada in 2020. Interviews were transcribed and returned to participants for their approval. Approved transcripts were then coded by all members of the research team to ascertain the dominant themes emerging across the interviews. Results Two prominent themes emerged in the interviews. The first theme is Indigenous doulas responding to community needs. Participants indicated that responding to community needs involves harm reduction and trauma-informed care, supporting cultural aspects of birthing and family, and helping clients navigate socioeconomic barriers. The second theme is Indigenous doulas building connections with mothers. Participants' comments on providing care to mothers emphasize the importance of advocacy in healthcare systems, boosting their clients' confidence and skills, and being the right doula for their clients. These two inter-related themes stem from Indigenous doulas' efforts to counter dynamics in healthcare and social services that can be harmful to Indigenous families, while also integrating cultural teachings and practices. Conclusion This paper illustrates that Indigenous doula care responds to a wide range of issues that affect Indigenous women's experiences of pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period. Through building strong, trusting, and non-judgemental connections with mothers and responding to community needs, Indigenous doulas play a critical role in countering medical racism in hospital settings and advancing the resurgence of Indigenous birthing sovereignty.","[Cidro, Jaime; Doenmez, Caroline; Nychuk, Alexandra; Wodtke, Larissa; Hayward, Ashley] Univ Winnipeg, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Sinclair, Stephanie] Univ Manitoba, 66 Chancellors Cir, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Winnipeg; University of Manitoba,"Cidro, J (corresponding author), Univ Winnipeg, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",j.cidro@uwinnipeg.ca,"Nychuk, Alexandra/AFQ-3002-2022","Nychuk, Alexandra/0000-0001-8508-209X",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),Funding was provided for this project through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).,,35,11,13,2,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1475-9276,,INT J EQUITY HEALTH,Int.

This paper provides evidence of inequities related to race-ethnicity and gender in graduate school experiences and career plans of PhD students in the top 100 ranked departments in one science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) discipline, chemistry. Mixed-model regression analyses were used to examine factors that might moderate these differences. The results show that graduate students who identified as a member of a racial/ethnic group traditionally underrepresented in chemistry (underrepresented minorities, URM) were significantly less likely than other students to report that their financial support was sufficient to meet their needs. They were also less likely to report having supportive relationships with peers and postdocs. Women, and especially URM women, were significantly less likely to report supportive relationships with advisors. Despite their more negative experiences in graduate school, students who identified as URM expressed greater commitment to finishing their degree and staying in the field. When there was at least one faculty member within their departments who also identified as URM they were also more likely than other students to aspire to a university professorship with an emphasis on research. Men were significantly more likely than women to express strong commitment to finishing the PhD and remaining in chemistry, but this difference was stronger in top-ranked departments. Men were also more likely than women to aspire to a professorship with an emphasis on research, and this difference remained when individual and departmental-level variables were controlled.","[Stockard, Jean] Univ Oregon, Dept Planning Publ Policy & Management, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Rohlfing, Celeste M.] Univ Oregon, Comm Adv Women Chemists COACh, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Richmond, Geraldine L.] Univ Oregon, Dept Chem, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon; University of Oregon; University of Oregon,"Richmond, GL (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Dept Chem, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",richmond@uoregon.edu,,"Stockard, Jean/0000-0001-6134-7233","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy [DE-FG02-03ER46061]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-FG02-03ER46061] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This material is based upon work supported by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy under Award DE-FG02-03ER46061.

We evaluate two separate models for the source of individual variance: conflicting values and direct effects of values.

However, such efforts have failed to significantly increase the percentage of Black women in computing. For example, only 1% of the 28,884 bachelor's degrees in computing were awarded to Black women in 2018. Moreover, too few empirical studies have intentionally explored the lived experiences of Black women, an often overlooked and understudied population in the computing ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce intersectionality - the complex overlap of socially constructed identities such as race, gender, class, sexuality, etc. - as a theoretical framework and springboard for exploring the lived experiences of Black women in computing. We interview 14 Black women in various stages of the computing ecosystem (undergraduate students, graduate students and early career professionals) to understand how intersectionality influences their ability to persist in computing. Preliminary findings from the analysis of the 14 interviews provides insights into how the interlocking systems of oppression (i.e., gendered racism) play out in computing education and negatively impact the recruitment and retention of Black women in the field of computing.","[Rankin, Yolanda A.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Thomas, Jakita O.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Rankin, YA (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",yrankin@fsu.edu; jnt0020@auburn.edu,,,NSF [1937759]; Florida State University [138000-551-041995]; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1937759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Florida State University; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),This research is generously supported via NSF grant 1937759 and Florida State University grant 138000-551-041995.,,39,44,58,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-6793-6,,,,2020,,,,,,,199,205,,10.1145/3328778.3366873,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366873,,,7,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BT2KW,,Bronze,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000810169400034,View Full Record in Web of Science

Racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic concordance was found to impact patient-physician communication positively and to lead to improved healthcare quality and outcomes. Patients' preference for ethnic discordance, on the other hand, appears anomalous and has barely been studied. The present research sought to evaluate the rates of patients from the Jewish majority and the Arab minority populations in Israel who prefer patient-physician ethnic discordance, and to examine the reasons for this preference. A mixed method methodology was employed: a survey (n = 760; 505 Jews, 255 Arabs), as well an exploratory qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 38 Jewish and Arab patients in Israel. The survey's findings indicate that Arabs are more likely to prefer to be treated by a Jewish physician than are Jews to prefer an Arab physician (family physician - 4.3% vs. 0.4%, p < .0001; surgeon - 5.9% vs. 0.8%, p < .0001). The difference is age-dependent: young Arabs are more likely than older ones to prefer a Jewish physician. The reasons for Arabs' preference for a Jewish physician are fear of a breach of confidentiality, and internalized racism. The reasons for Jews' preference for an Arab physician are the disposition and professionalism attributed to the latter, which are perceived to stem from their need, as a minority population, to excel and to prove themselves. Despite the emphasis placed in scholarship and clinical practice on the importance of cultural and linguistic competency in healthcare, a preference for ethnic discordance should also be taken into account, especially regarding patients from minority collectivist populations.","[Keshet, Yael] Western Galilee Acad Coll, Max Stern Yezreel Valley Coll, 19th Yezreel St, Tiveon, Israel",,"Keshet, Y (corresponding author), Western Galilee Acad Coll, Max Stern Yezreel Valley Coll, 19th Yezreel St, Tiveon, Israel.",yaelk@wgalil.ac.il,,,,,,,50,9,10,2,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-9536,,,SOC SCI MED,Soc.

Due in large part to inequitable access to college-preparatory curriculum in secondary schooling, racially minoritized community college students are more likely than their White peers to be placed in developmental (remedial) math coursework, and less likely to complete the developmental requirements. Over the past decade, heightened concern with high rates of non-completion in developmental math has led community colleges to engage in an unprecedented level of reform, restructuring their programs in order to facilitate students' progression into college level math and science courses. However, whether such reforms have improved minoritized students' opportunities to learn remains unclear. In this study, we applied a race-conscious analytical framework in order to explore the messages embedded in curricular artifacts from developmental math courses at a college pursuing reform. Using indicators of equity-mindedness, we examined the extent to which the curricular artifacts embody explicit messages about diversity and cultural inclusiveness, reflect aspects of culturally responsive teaching, or challenge assumptions embedded in the dominant approach to mathematics education (i.e., racial apathy and color blindness). In addition to documenting a lack of equity-mindedness and cultural inclusivity in our sample of cultural artifacts, our analysis offers a set of tools for researching and assessing ongoing developmental math reforms across community colleges.","[Cox, Rebecca D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, 250-13450 102nd Ave, Surrey, BC V3T 5X3, Canada; [Malcom-Piqueux, Lindsey E.] CALTECH, Divers Inclus & Assessment, Mail Code 112-31, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Simon Fraser University; California Institute of Technology,"Cox, RD (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Educ, 250-13450 102nd Ave, Surrey, BC V3T 5X3, Canada.",rdcox@sfu.ca,,,,,,,72,0,0,0,0,BEGELL HOUSE INC,DANBURY,"50 NORTH ST, DANBURY, CT 06810 USA",1072-8325,1940-431X,,J WOMEN MINOR SCI EN,J.

It is composed of three distinct but interrelated parts that together map the past, present, and future of addressing racial inequities in Maternal and Child Health.DescriptionThis paper is composed of three distinct but interrelated parts that together map the past, present, and future of addressing racial inequities in Maternal and Child Health. Part I recounts the history and achievements of a Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention initiative in the 1980-90's, led by the Prematurity Research Group in the Division of Reproductive Health, Pregnancy and Infant Health Branch. This initiative stimulated a paradigm shift in how we understand and address black infant mortality and the inequities in this outcome. Part II illustrates examples of some exemplary programmatic and policy legacies that stemmed either directly or indirectly from the Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention paradigm shift. Part III provides a discussion of how effectively the current practice in Maternal and Child Health applies this paradigm to address inequities and proposes a path for accelerating Title V agencies' progress toward birth equity.AssessmentThis CDC initiative was transformative in that it raised the visibility of African American researchers, moved the field from a focus on traditional epidemiologic risks such as personal health promotion and medical interventions, to include racism as a risk factor for inequitable birth outcomes. The paradigm examined the specific roles of historical and structural racism, and the racialized, contextualized, and temporal exposures that are unique to Black women's experiences in the United States.ConclusionThe initiative radically changed the narratives about the underlying factors contributing to inequities in birth outcomes of Black women, altered the way we currently approach addressing inequities, and holds the keys for transforming practice to a more holistic and systematic approach to building sustained organizational structures in maternal and child health that accelerate the achievement of birth equity. SignificanceRevisiting a key initiative in Maternal and Child Health history can help to better evaluate and refine current practices so that progress toward the achievement of reproductive justice and equity can be accelerated.","[Rowley, Diane L.] Morehouse Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Hogan, Vijaya K.] Vijaya K Hogan Consulting LLC, 300 Colonial Ctr Pkwy,Ste 100N, Roswell, GA 30076 USA; [Abresch, Chad] CityMatCH, Omaha, NE USA; [Abresch, Chad] Univ Nebraska Med Ctr, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot, Omaha, NE USA",Morehouse School of Medicine; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Medical Center,"Hogan, VK (corresponding author), Vijaya K Hogan Consulting LLC, 300 Colonial Ctr Pkwy,Ste 100N, Roswell, GA 30076 USA.",vkhconsulting08@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,1,1,3,4,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1092-7875,1573-6628,,MATERN CHILD HLTH J,Matern.

This underscored literally and metaphorically how difficult it is for Black men to thrive in a hostile environment where their civil rights are denied. This article addresses the killings of unarmed Black men by the police, arguing that such killings are motivated by factors including how race, racism, and gender contribute to the othering of their humanity. Ideas from Critical Race Theory, the nexus among policing, criminality and racial profiling, critical consciousness, relational theory, and narrative therapy will provide a foundation for understanding the racialized experiences of Black men in Americawhere multiple forms of injustices existand where police killings are viewed as lawful. Highlighting practice themes from a case vignette involving an adolescent Black male engaged in psychotherapy will explicate how racial profiling by the police triggered race-based traumatic stress. The vignette will illuminate the implications for psychotherapeutic work with Black men who have been affected by race-based traumatic stress stemming from living while Black.","[Aymer, Samuel R.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Silberman Sch Social Work, 2180 Third Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Aymer, SR (corresponding author), CUNY Hunter Coll, Silberman Sch Social Work, 2180 Third Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",saymer@hunter.cuny.edu,,,,,,,38,62,151,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1091-1359,1540-3556,,J HUM BEHAV SOC ENVI,J.

Biases are ubiquitous throughout society, including the educational and healthcare environment. In health care it is at the patient-provider level that our biases play a major role in patient care exhibiting a rippling effect going beyond individual provider biases affecting not only patients and families but all members of the healthcare team. Methods: Although biases are in play across the entire medical school curriculum the most significant impact is during clerkships. During clerkships students are exposed to and prone to adopt and internalize identities and traits that may run counter to the basic tenants of medicine and the Hippocratic tradition of non-maleficence, beneficence, and compassion. Implicit biases develop early, are difficult to change and as shown by recent allegations of political figures appearing in blackface remain intact into adulthood. Conclusion/Recommendations: At the institutional level biases can be addressed and mitigated through cultural humility and implicit bias training, training in culturally and linguistically appropriate services, increased workforce diversity through support of STEM- based enrichment programs and curriculum changes that include clinical vignettes emphasizing the effects of race, gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity, on access and quality of care: reflective writing and small group sessions that provide safe spaces for students; and experiential learning in underserved communities. Resulting in an educational environment that directly addresses the role of implicit bias, racism, and discrimination in individual and population health.","[Thomas, Billy; Booth-McCoy, Amber N.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, 4301 West Markham, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Thomas, B (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Pediat, 4301 West Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA.",thomasbillyr@uams.edu,,"Thomas, Billy/0000-0002-3057-6583",,,,,42,9,11,1,8,NATL MED ASSOC,WASHINGON,"1012 10TH ST, N W, WASHINGON, DC 20001 USA",0027-9684,1943-4693,,J NATL MED ASSOC,J.

Amid the recent national movement to dismantle systemic racism and racial injustices, many scientists publicly highlighted the prevalence of racist learning environments in STEM, contributing to the underrepresentation of Black students in STEM fields. Acknowledging this longstanding troubling reality, this article emphasizes the instrumental role of chemistry department chairs in advancing Black student success in chemistry and STEM broadly. Guided by literature on systemic change and equity in higher education as well as our research on the Black student experience and teaching practices in chemistry, this article describes the following five recommendations for actions that chemistry chairs should consider enacting to promote equitymindedness within their departments to advance Black student success: (i) disaggregate data to make publicly visible racial inequities; (ii) offer formal opportunities for Black students to candidly share their perspectives; (iii) conduct systematic assessment of course syllabus; (iv) measure teaching practices; and (v) create chemistry education research positions. The enactment of these recommendations by chemistry chairs provides meaningful opportunities for faculty and staff to critically examine the chemistry learning environment using an equity-minded approach to in turn inform the development of strategic efforts to support the advancement of Black student success.","[Collins, Jennifer Shalini; Olesik, Susan, V] Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Collins, JS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",collins.1711@osu.edu,"Olesik, Susan/G-5845-2016","Olesik, Susan/0000-0001-7757-5150",Ohio State University Office of Student Academic Success Research grant; Ohio State University Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry,Ohio State University Office of Student Academic Success Research grant; Ohio State University Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry,The production of this article was made possible through funding from The Ohio State University's Office of Student Academic Success Research grant and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

Stemming from the tsarist and Soviet pasts, these meanings of Blackness (and whiteness) have been refracted by the dramatic socioeconomic and political shifts since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This article draws on the accounts of working-class devout Muslim women, with whom the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in Saint Petersburg between 2015 and 2017, to elucidate their experiences of how anti-Muslim racism operates as a tool of exclusion, deployed along racial, religious, ethnic, class, and gender lines. The women's daily responses to anti-Muslim racism suggest how solidarities might sustain communities targeted by racism, while laying the foundations for future intersectional anti-racist movements in the country.","[Rabinovich, Tatiana] North Carolina State Univ, Interdisciplinary studies, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Rabinovich, T (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Interdisciplinary studies, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",1536-6936,1547-8424,,MERIDIANS,Meridians,OCT,2021,20,2,,,,,396,413,,10.1215/15366936-9547943,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/15366936-9547943,,,19,Women's Studies,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Women's Studies,2F7GV,,Bronze,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000813075400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

While Merton perceived the threat to the autonomy of science as coming from outside the walls of academe, mainly in the form of nationalism and racism, the subsequent rise of neoliberalism and global market forces means that the scientific ethos is being undermined largely from within the university itself, leading to the DECAY (i.e. differentialism, egoism, capitalism and advocacy) of CUDOS. The STEM-ification of the humanities and social sciences academic community has led to the rise of a post-academic ethos. This manifests itself in professional pragmatism with academics facing both ways at the same time by remaining largely committed to Mertonian norms in theory but needing to adapt to the performative demands of DECAY as a new set of institutional norms that prevails in practice.","[Macfarlane, Bruce] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Macfarlane, Bruce] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Macfarlane, B (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",profbmac@gmail.com,,,,,,,58,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-4985,1465-3915,,OXFORD REV EDUC,Oxf.

Asian Immigration and the Adoption of Planning and Design Regulations in Three Los Angeles Suburbs,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,architectural styles; Asian American communities; design control; urban form,LANDSCAPES; POLITICS,"Problem, research strategy, and findings We examined land use and design controls in three municipalities in Los Angeles County (CA)-Alhambra, Arcadia, and San Gabriel-that have experienced a recent influx of Asian residents. We drew from archival research of newspaper articles, planning documents, city council and planning commission meeting minutes, and interviews with 14 local planners, architects, planning and design review commissioners, and resident groups. We found that the three cities developed stringent development controls, encouraged Anglo or Spanish heritage architectural styles, and issued new guidelines and ordinances during the period of changing demographics. These actions often stemmed from White residents' fear of losing their neighborhoods and interest in maintaining their existing landscapes. We detail here four contestations relating to mansionization, architectural styles, historic preservation, and massage parlors. Takeaway for practice The study is important for planning practice because it shows that development controls and design guidelines may be developed in reaction to increased anxieties about immigration and in ways that counteract the interests and values of some minority residents. Planners in ethnically diverse communities need to be aware of and respond to the possible exclusionary effects of design and land use controls. They need to better listen to newcomers' concerns, integrate their voices in decision making, and educate both newcomers and long-time residents about the importance of each other's cultural heritage. Planners may seek to exercise professional ingenuity in developing and implementing design and planning regulations that better balance spatial identities and accommodate conflicting tastes.","[Ding, Hao] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Loukaitou-Sideris, Anastasia] UCLA Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Ding, H (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Urban Planning, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",haoding@ucla.edu; sideris@ucla.edu,,,UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy,UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy,This work was supported by the UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy.,,44,3,3,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0194-4363,1939-0130,,J AM PLANN ASSOC,J.

Results suggest that despite participants' ability to navigate discriminatory behaviors, emotional stressors shaped their perceptions about the treatment Black students withstand in these courses.

While settler-colonization is often attributed as the main cause of lateral violence, research has not examined what specific aspects lead to lateral violence in Aboriginal communities. In a qualitative study, using yarning and thematic analysis, 17 Aboriginal Australians (53% male, 47% female) ranging in age from 18 to over 60, discussed what they believed to be the causes of lateral violence. Knowledge holders identified historical and contemporary causes and perpetuating factors of lateral violence, all of which were related to settler-colonialism. These causes included living in a colonial society, native title, access and competition for limited resources, the process of obtaining confirmation of Aboriginality certificate, identity issues and internalized racism, past traumas, and returning back to traditional lands. Settler-colonialism is a structure through which lateral violence was, and is, allowed to flourish.

Because the Confederacy fought to preserve slavery, which upheld this hierarchy, support for the Confederate flag may serve as a proxy measure for individuals' commitment to maintaining privileges stemming from structural racism. Moreover, given that the modern legal system upholds this same racial hierarchy through anti-Black discrimination, individuals who prioritize protecting their privilege may soothe the guilt they feel for benefiting from structural racism by convincing themselves the legal system treats everyone equally. Similarly, because flag supporters identify with the symbol of a failed nation that considered northern states to have insufficiently policed Black people, they may view police as protectors of the racial hierarchy. Hypotheses were tested using randomly sampled CBS News national poll data. As anticipated, flag supporters were 66% less likely to perceive anti-Black criminal justice system bias, 60% less likely to perceive anti-Black police bias, 34% less likely to consider racial profiling widespread, and 55% more likely to view police as friends.","[Updegrove, Alexander H.] Univ North Texas, Dept Criminal Justice, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Cooper, Maisha N.] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Criminal Justice & Criminol, Charlotte, NC USA; [Dmello, Jared R.] Texas A&M Int Univ, Dept Social Sci, Laredo, TX USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M International University,"Updegrove, AH (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, 1155 Union Cir, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",alexander.updegrove@unt.edu,"Dmello, Jared R./AAG-7216-2020","Dmello, Jared R./0000-0001-8805-1061",,,,,71,1,2,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2153-3687,,,RACE JUSTICE,Race Justice,JAN,2024,14,1,,,,,32,53,2.15337E+16,10.1177/21533687211023574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21533687211023574,,JUL 2021,22,Criminology & Penology; Ethnic Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Criminology & Penology; Ethnic Studies,CR2F3,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000679503900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In May 2020, widespread Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests occurred as a result of the publicized police murder of George Floyd. This article analyzes Instagram posts of popular food bloggers responding to COVID-19 and BLM protests. I find that food bloggers tend to discuss these issues on their Instagram accounts from an individualized perspective, reflecting US ideology toward individualism and failure to act on structural racism. I frame food blogs as a modern form of self-help models and literature which impede the ability to see structural problems and find structural solutions. The individualized approaches taken by food bloggers tend to reflect their privilege as white, middle-class women while also demonstrating continued gendered pressures to work, maintain the household, and raise a healthy family. Overall findings demonstrate the tension between individual level approaches to racism and structural reform needed to combat racism, resulting in depoliticization of issues stemming from systemic racism, impeding effort to create a conversation regarding impactful institutional change.","[Gonzales, Gabrielle G.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Gonzales, GG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",gabrielleggonzales@ucsb.edu,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0273-2173,1521-0707,,SOCIOL SPECTRUM,Sociol.

As a result of multifaceted systemic barriers, thesestudents receive lower grades and leave STEM at higher rates comparedto their peers, highlighting the need for equity-focused educationalinterventions. Drawing upon Quantitative Critical Race Theory, educationaldebts in organic chemistry owed by society were calculated for eachmarginalized group. As a result of participating in OrgoPrep, educationaldebts in GPA points were reduced or mitigated for nearly all marginalizedgroups, with the largest benefits seen in Black students. Disproportionatelylarger mitigative impacts on attrition measured via drop, failure,and withdrawal (DFW) rates were detected for nearly all marginalizedgroups. Specifically, debts in the DFW rate were reduced for womenand low-income students and eliminated for Black and Hispanic students.These findings demonstrate that OrgoPrep can appreciably reduce educationaldebts due to racism and sexism with a mixed impact on debts due toclassism. Similar supplementary programs may play a key role in mitigatingthe effects of racism, sexism, and classism in the STEM pipeline.","[Torres, Daniela; Pulukuri, Surya; Abrams, Binyomin] Boston Univ, Dept Chem, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Abrams, Binyomin] Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Dept Teaching & Learning, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; Boston University,"Abrams, B (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Chem, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Abrams, B (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Wheelock Coll Educ & Human Dev, Dept Teaching & Learning, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",abramsb@bu.edu,"Abrams, Binyomin/KEH-3125-2024","Abrams, Binyomin/0000-0002-1507-3144; Pulukuri, Surya/0000-0002-0751-0201",Boston University Office of Digital Learning and Innovation (DLamp;I); Digital Education Incubator (DEI); Boston University Chemistry department; Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP); Boston University Educational Resource Center (ERC),Boston University Office of Digital Learning and Innovation (DLamp;I); Digital Education Incubator (DEI); Boston University Chemistry department; Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP); Boston University Educational Resource Center (ERC),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Boston University Office of Digital Learning and Innovation (DL&I), the Digital Education Incubator (DEI), the Boston University Chemistry department, the Boston University Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), and the Boston University Educational Resource Center (ERC).",,50,1,1,3,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-9584,1938-1328,,J CHEM EDUC,J.

The literature reveals that several K-16 interventions have been designed to increase the representation of Black women and girls in computing. Despite these best efforts, the needle seems to have barely moved in increasing the representation or the retention of Black women in computing. Instead, the primary goals have been to recruit and retain women in the CS pipeline using gender-focused efforts intended to increase the number of women who also identify as members of racialized groups. However, these gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge or appreciate how intersectionality (the overlapping social constructs of gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.) has shaped the lived experiences of Black women navigating the computing pipeline. Without honest dialogue about how power operates in the field of computing, the push for racial equality and social justice in CS education remains an elusive goal. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework to address systemic oppression (i.e., racism, gender discrimination, power, and privilege), we interview 24 Black women in different phases of the computing pipeline about their experiences navigating the field of computing. An intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three primary saturated sites of violence within CS education: (1) traditional K-12 classrooms; (2) predominantly White institutions; and (3) internships as supplementary learning experiences. We conclude the article with implications for how the field of CS education can begin to address racial inequality that negatively impacts Black girls and women, thus contributing to a more equitable and socially just field of study that benefits all students.","[Rankin, Yolanda A.] Florida State Univ, 142 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Thomas, Jakita O.] Auburn Univ, 3101G Shelby Ctr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Erete, Sheena] DePaul Univ, 243 South Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; DePaul University,"Rankin, YA (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, 142 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",yrankin@cci.fsu.edu; jnt0020@auburn.edu; serete@cdm.depaul.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1937759]; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1937759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),This research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation Grant no. 1937759.,,112,19,23,5,17,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1946-6226,,,ACM T COMPUT EDUC,ACM Trans.

Additionally, across all HBCU stakeholders' surveys, students had a statistically significant higher response when asked if the transition to virtual learning increased their overall levels of stress and anxiety.Conclusions: During a global pandemic, HBCUs continue to provide a culture of support and inclusion for students, faculty, and staff in engineering. Increased stress levels experienced by students indicate that a safe and adequate transition back to campus is essential for their social and academic persistence. Due to the well-documented inequities HBCUs faced before the pandemic, the impact of this unprecedented on their continued contributions toward broadening participation in engineering for students should be further explored.","[Fletcher, Trina L.] Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Sch Universal Comp Construct & Engn Educ SUCCEED, STEM READi Lab, 10555 West Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Jefferson, Jay P.] Florida Int Univ, Div Divers Equ & Inclus, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Boyd, Brittany] Amer Inst Res, Arlington, VA USA; [Park, Sung Eun] Florida Int Univ, Sch Universal Comp, Construction & Engn Educ SUCCEED, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Crumpton-Young, Lesia] Texas Southern Univ, Houston, TX USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; American Institutes for Research; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Texas Southern University,"Fletcher, TL (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, STEM Transformat Inst, Sch Universal Comp Construct & Engn Educ SUCCEED, STEM READi Lab, 10555 West Flagler St, Miami, FL 33174 USA.",trfletch@fiu.edu; jajeffer@fiu.edu; bboyd@air.org; supark@fiu.edu; presidentyoung@tsu.edu,,"Fletcher, Trina/0000-0002-1765-5957","National Science Foundation [2031221, 1923229]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: 2031221, 1923229",,89,1,1,3,9,AMER SOC ENGINEERING EDUCATION,WASHINGTON,"1818 N ST, N W, STE 600, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1069-4730,2168-9830,,J ENG EDUC,J.

Results: Results of confirmatory factor analysis and differential item functioning (DIF) analysis suggest that changing the item stem (from 'because you are Black' to 'because of your race/ethnicity') and removing four items that show differential item functioning and/or do not load on the first factor, results in a psychometrically sound scale with no evidence of measurement bias. Conclusion: Researchers interested in measuring racial discrimination in samples that include both Black and White respondents may consider using this version of the SRE. Future studies should investigate other forms of validity in Black and White samples.","[Wagner, Julie] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Div Behav Sci & Community Hlth, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Feinn, Richard] Quinnipiac Univ, Frank H Nedder MD Sch Med, Hamden, CT 06518 USA; [Schumann, Kristina P.] Connecticut Healthcare Syst, West Haven, CT USA; [Tennen, Howard] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Community Med & Healthcare, Farmington, CT 06030 USA",University of Connecticut; Quinnipiac University; University of Connecticut,"Wagner, J (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Div Behav Sci & Community Hlth, MC3910,263 Farmington Ave, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.",juwagner@uchc.edu,,,"National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases [R21 DK074468]; American Diabetes Association [7-05-CR-31]; American Heart Association [0535301N]; Uconn Health Center General Clinical Research Center [M01RR006192]","National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); American Diabetes Association(American Diabetes Association); American Heart Association(American Heart Association); Uconn Health Center General Clinical Research Center","This research was supported by grants to Dr. Wagner from the National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (R21 DK074468), the American Diabetes Association (7-05-CR-31), the American Heart Association (0535301N), and the Uconn Health Center General Clinical Research Center (M01RR006192).",,24,4,5,0,9,"ETHNICITY & DISEASE, INC",OWINGS MILL,"9812 SHERWOOD FARM RD, OWINGS MILL, MD, UNITED KINGDOM",1049-510X,1945-0826,,ETHNIC DIS,Ethn.

Isolation limits women of color ability to form supportive networks to deal with the stressors that result from bias and discrimination. Isolation can also prevent women of color from creating support networks that may buffer against stressors. We used a grounded approach to explore the extent to which being the only woman of color, versus one of a few, mediates the experiences of incivility, harassment, and broader discriminatory practices experienced by science faculty across rank. We ran six focus groups with a total of 15 women of color science faculty at a research-intensive Midwestern university to explore these themes. Our research supports previous findings that women of color of all ranks experience negative workplace experiences such as incivility and harassment, and the exclusion of women of color occurs at both institutional and interpersonal levels. Our findings yielded new insights into how experiences of social isolation lead to the internalization of gaslighting messages that deny or minimize the occurrence of incivility and harassment. We also found that social support helps women to contextualize their experiences, allowing them to recognize and identify it within the broader cultural patterns of sexism and racism. Social exclusion and isolation intensify the negative psychological impact of negative workplace experiences, whereas social support validates women of color negative experiences and helps externalize these events. Therefore, we suggest that the level of isolation experienced by women of color faculty can mediate the relationship between negative experiences in academic science and personal and professional outcomes such as mental health and productivity. We use this model of psychological impacts of incivility and harassment to suggest future areas of research regarding women of color in STEM.","[Rodrigues, Michelle A.; Clancy, Kathryn B.

Wallace; Korean War; decolonization; race; dissent; Progressive Party,,"This article examines U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace's Cold War dissent as a window into racial geopolitics in a post-World War II era of decolonization and U.S. global power. Focused on Wallace and the United States, the article uses a wide range of published and archival sources to argue that Wallace and U.S. anticolonial liberal elites saw anti-racist egalitarian pressures in the post-1945 international system as not only a threat, as existing scholarship suggests, but also an opportunity for U.S. global expansion-particularly in the Pacific Rim. By the 1960s, Wallace and postwar anti-racist activists diminished in influence amid global Cold War pressures reviving racial restrictions and Cold War militarization after the Korean War. Nonetheless, Wallace's anti-racist diplomacy, stemming from long-running U.S. and global liberal debates and political struggles over race and empire, suggests the wider role of anti-racist geopolitics and the paradoxical persistence of race as a global cultural concept in the postwar era.","[Kim, Kevin Y.] Univ Washington Bothell, Bothell, WA 98011 USA; [Kim, Kevin Y.] Harvard Univ, Charles Warren Ctr Studies Amer Hist, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Bothell; Harvard University,"Kim, KY (corresponding author), Univ Washington Bothell, Bothell, WA 98011 USA.;Kim, KY (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Charles Warren Ctr Studies Amer Hist, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Stanford University's School of Humanities and Sciences; Stanford University's Truman Library Institute,Stanford University's School of Humanities and Sciences; Stanford University's Truman Library Institute,"The author would like to thank the article's anonymous reviewers for their incisive suggestions, and Gordon H.

Structural racism contributes to the disparate concentration of violence in communities of color. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, increasing trends in community violence show racial and geographic disparities that emphasize the need for cross-sector, data-driven approaches to program and policy change. Cross-sector collaborations are challenged by data sharing barriers that hinder implementation. Program: In response to community advocacy, Mecklenburg County Public Health (MCPH) launched a Community Violence Prevention Plan with evidence-based programming. The Cure Violence (CV) model, a public health approach to disrupting violence through equitable resource provision, network building, and changing norms, was implemented at the community level. The Health Alliance for Violence Intervention (HAVI) model, a hospital-based screening and case management intervention for victims of violence, was implemented at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, the region's only level I trauma center. Methods: A data collaborative was created to optimize evaluation of CV and HAVI programs including MCPH, the city of Charlotte, Atrium Health, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Johnson C. Smith University, and the University of North Carolina Charlotte. A comprehensive approach to facilitate data sharing was designed with a focus on engaging stakeholders and generating solutions to commonly reported barriers. Structured interviews were used to inform a solution-focused strategy. Results: Stakeholders reported perceptions of their organization's barriers and facilitators to cross-sector data sharing. Common technology, legal, and governance barriers were addressed through partnership with a local integrated data system. Solutions for trust and motivational challenges were built into ongoing collaborative processes. Discussion: Data silos inhibit the understanding of complex public health issues such as community violence, along with the design and evaluation of collective impact efforts. This approach can be replicated and scaled to support cross-sector collaborations seeking to influence social and health inequities stemming from structural racism.","[Mayfield, Carlene A.] Atrium Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, 4135 S Stream Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28217 USA; [Siegal, Rachel; Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol Sci, Charlotte, NC USA; [Herring, Melvin] Johnson C Smith Univ, Dept Social Work, Charlotte, NC USA; [Campbell, Tracie] Mecklenburg Cty Publ Hlth, Off Violence Prevent, Charlotte, NC USA; [Clark, Catie L.] Mecklenburg Cty Criminal Justice Serv, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Johnson C Smith University,"Mayfield, CA (corresponding author), Atrium Hlth, Dept Community Hlth, 4135 S Stream Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28217 USA.",carlene.mayfield@atriumhealth.org; rsiegal@uncc.edu; mherring@jcsu.edu; tracie.campbell@mecklenburgcountync.gov; Catie.Clark@mecklenburgcountync.gov; jlanghin@uncc.edu,"Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer/W-1756-2019","Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Jennifer/0000-0002-3603-9201",Data Across Sectors for Health (DASH) Mentor 3.0 Program,Data Across Sectors for Health (DASH) Mentor 3.0 Program,"This work was supported, in part, by the Data Across Sectors for Health (DASH) Mentor 3.0 Program.",,32,3,4,3,13,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1078-4659,1550-5022,,J PUBLIC HEALTH MAN,J.

Stahl's Imitation of Life,FILM HISTORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fredi Washington; African Americans; film censorship; Production Code; passing; racial violence,,"This paper argues that a lynching scene that was cut from Imitation of Life (1934) likely comprised the original dramatic ending of the film. This knowledge should cause us to rethink the ideological motivations behind the resolution that the film eventually invented, in which the tragic mulatto daughter Peola (Fredi Washington) appears at her black mother Delilah's (Louise Beavers) funeral and tearfully repents for breaking her heart. The lynching scene's removal brings into relief not only how the film navigates its racial commentary but also how its maternal melodramatic apparatus counteracts attempts to address racism as a social problem. This avoidance in part stems from the film's refusal to address how sexuality-specifically, paranoia of miscegenation-motivates racist violence. Instead, the film posits racism as a personal and familial problem between two women.","[Lew, Kirsten M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Lew, KM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept English, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,2,INDIANA UNIV PRESS,BLOOMINGTON,"601 N MORTON STREET, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47404-3797 USA",0892-2160,1553-3905,,FILM HIST,Film Hist.,WIN,2018,30,4,,,,,107,126,,10.2979/filmhistory.30.4.05,http://dx.doi.org/10.2979/filmhistory.30.4.05,,,20,"Film, Radio, Television",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Film, Radio & Television",HK8DR,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000458220100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Anti-Black racism is, as defined by the Movement for Black Lives, a term used to specifically describe the unique discrimination, violence, and harm imposed on and impacting Black people specifically. In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), we have yet to achieve the goal and responsibility to ensure that the field reflects the diversity of our lived experiences. Members of the Women in Molecular Imaging Network (WIMIN) have come together to take a stand on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of molecular imaging. We strongly condemn oppression in all its forms and strive to identify and dismantle barriers that lead to inequities in the molecular imaging community and STEM as a whole. In this series coined Visions (Antiracism and Allyship in Action), we identify and discuss specific actionable items for improving diversity and representation in molecular imaging and ensuring inclusion of all members of the community, inclusive of race, disability, ethnicity, religion, or LGBTQ+ identity. Although the issues highlighted here extend to other under-recruited and equity-seeking groups, for this first article, we are focusing on one egregious and persistent form of discrimination: anti-Black racism. In this special article, Black women residing in America present their lived experiences in the molecular imaging field and give candid insights into the challenges, frustrations, and hopes of our Black friends and colleagues. While this special article focuses on the experiences of Black women, we would like the readers to reflect on their anti-Blackness toward men, transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming people. From the vulnerability we have asked of all our participants, these stories are meant to inspire and invoke active antiracist work among the readership. We present strategies for dismantling systemic racism that research centers and universities can implement in the recruitment, retention, mentorship, and development of Black trainees and professionals. We would like to specifically acknowledge the Black women who took the time to be interviewed, write perspectives, and share their lived experiences in hopes that it will inspire genuine and lasting change.","[Akam, Eman] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Azevedo, Carmen; Chaney, Aisling M.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dhanvantari, Savita] Lawson Hlth Res Inst, London, ON, Canada; [Dhanvantari, Savita] Western Univ, London, ON, Canada; [Edwards, Kimberly J.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Henry, Kelly E.; Ijoma, Jenny N.; Mack, Kyeara N.; Nagle, Veronica L.; Pereira, Patricia M.

Most of these complaints stemmed from vague references to rumors of crimes rather than actual incidents. Black journalists and members of the NAACP refuted these accusations and argued that the real issue was discrimination against the soldiers and racism on the part of white Staten Islanders. These accusations launched a months-long debate about racism, crime, and policing on Staten Island during the war. Ultimately, the mayor and military authorities responded by intensifying policing and surveillance of the soldiers.

Using structural equation modeling, we found that Asian participants reported experiencing higher discrimination during the first month of the pandemic (e.g., being treated as if you have a disease) compared to White participants. Experienced discrimination was associated with significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety and significantly lower levels of academic engagement. In addition to the physical and economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, racism and discrimination may pose unique challenges for Asian Americans in particular.","[Inman, Elizabeth M.; Bermejo, Rosa M.; McDanal, Riley; Nelson, Brady; Richmond, Lauren L.; Schleider, Jessica L.; London, Bonita] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, 100 Nicholls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Inman, EM (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, 100 Nicholls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",elizabeth.inman@stonybrook.edu,,"Inman, Elizabeth/0000-0002-0679-138X; Bermejo, Rosa/0000-0001-8004-9872; London, Bonita/0000-0003-0409-641X; McDanal, Riley/0000-0002-4607-4131; Nelson, Brady/0000-0003-3214-8977; Schleider, Jessica/0000-0003-2426-1953",National Science Foundation Division of Human Resource Development Grant [2032386]; Div. of Equity for Excellence in STEM; Directorate for STEM Education [2032386] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation Division of Human Resource Development Grant; Div. of Equity for Excellence in STEM; Directorate for STEM Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)NSF - Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM),This study was funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Human Resource Development Grant no. 2032386.,,15,6,11,0,5,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",2376-6972,2376-6964,,STIGMA HEALTH,Stigma Health,NOV,2021,6,4,,,,,380,383,,10.1037/sah0000349,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/sah0000349,,,4,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychology, Social",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychology",WU1VC,,hybrid,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000716339000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, at least one methodology-electrodermal activity recording (skin conductance responses)-may be influenced not only by potential phenotypic differences but also by negative psychological effects stemming from the lived experience of racism. Here we situate these issues within structural injustice, urge researchers to challenge racism in their scientific work and propose procedures and changes that may lead to more equitable science. Human neuroscience methods (for example, electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electrodermal response) are biased to exclude data from dark skin and coarse hair-traits common in Black people-and possibly people with racial trauma.

Here, the discussion focuses on Black masculinities, identity formation, and the role of science educators in making STEM fields a welcoming place for young Black men. Drawing from Mark's data and discussion, this paper is a dialogue between science identity possibilities in the United States and in Brazil when we look at the intersections of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using the shared colonial past of both countries a connection is established to address race relations within science education.

Many successful blacks tend to resist racism via strategies informed by the hegemonic neoliberal and individualistic ethos, with the key strategies being educational and occupational attainment. Such individualistic strategies are opposed by antiracism education, which emphasizes battling racism on structural and institutional levels. I argue that this disconnect between middle-class black consciousness and antiracist discourse stems from the general failure of antiracist scholarship to understand adequately the complex and conflicted identities and lived experiences of many successful blacks. This failure on the part of antiracist scholarship can be attributed to a historical premising on binary racial categories and zero-sum conceptions of power. However, recent post-structuralist trends in antiracist scholarship, such as an increasing emphasis on integrative antiracism, hold the promise of creating an antiracist discourse that better resonates with successful blacks.","[Gosine, Kevin] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University,"Gosine, K (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Sociol, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",kgosine@brocku.ca,,,,,,,43,3,6,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0896-9205,1569-1632,,CRIT SOCIOL,Crit.

Meanwhile, the policies materially interact to affect border peoples by creating or exacerbating such harms as immigrant smuggling, vigilante justice, and civil rights and labor violations. This Comment criticizes the trade-immigration separation and catalogues the resulting border conditions. It argues that the separation of trade and immigration likely stems not simply from economic rationales, but from an understanding of the national interest grounded in nativistic racism and a conception of the nation that excludes border peoples. This Comment offers nativistic racism as an underlying, but dominant, national value that undercuts effective U.S. border policy and maintains the unrealistic separation of trade and immigration policies. Finally, this Comment assesses the likelihood of curing the ills described through traditional legal or policymaking approaches, ultimately calling for a redefinition of the national interest.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Gallegos, Gabriela/0009-0006-0605-4714",,,,,117,8,11,0,5,UNIV CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SCH LAW,BERKELEY,"BOAT HALL, 588 SIMON HALL, BERKELEY, CA 94720-7200 USA",0008-1221,1942-6542,,CALIF LAW REV,Calif.

The biology curriculum appears to be a crucial locus of intervention for either reinforcing or undermining students' racial essentialist views. The Mendelian genetic models dominating textbooks, particularly in combination with racially inflected language sometimes used when teaching about monogenic disorders, can increase middle and high school students' racial essentialism and opposition to policies to increase equity. These findings are of particular concern given the increasing spread of racist misinformation online and the misappropriation of human genomics research by white supremacists, who take advantage of low levels of genetics literacy in the general public. Encouragingly, however, teaching updated information about the geographical distribution of human genetic variation and the complex, multifactorial basis of most human traits, reduces students' endorsement of racial essentialism. The genetics curriculum is therefore a key tool in combating misinformation and scientific racism. Here, we describe a framework and example teaching materials for teaching students key concepts in genetics, human evolutionary history, and human phenotypic variation at the undergraduate level. This framework can be flexibly applied in biology and anthropology classes and adjusted based on time availability. Our goal is to provide undergraduate-level instructors with varying levels of expertise with a set of evidence-informed tools for teaching human genetics to combat scientific racism, including an evolving set of instructional resources, as well as learning goals and pedagogical approaches. Resources can be found at https://noto.li/YIlhZ5.

In an attempt to learn if young Black college students unknowingly contribute to the spread of the COVID-19 in their communities, using surveys, this pilot study gauges the general safety knowledge and basic scientific knowledge of Black college students about SARS-COV-2 virus and COVID-19 at an HBCU. We also investigated whether students enrolled in chemistry courses designed for STEM (Science, Technology, and Engineering Majors) majors displayed increased knowledge of SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 in comparison to their non-STEM major peers. Two sets of surveys with multiple choice questions, one with 25 and the other with 34 questions, were designed to assess general safety knowledge and basic scientific knowledge of the students about COVID-19 and the SARS-COV-2 virus. Survey questions were administered through Blackboard learning management system to one hundred eighty-seven (187) students in the summer of 2020 to two freshman non-science majors and in the fall of 2020 to one freshman non-science-major class, two freshmen STEM-major classes, and one senior STEM-major class. All students self-registered in the 6 chemistry classes at North Carolina A&T State University at random with no predetermined criteria. Results of the study show that regardless of their year of study, majority (> 90%) of the students possess basic scientific knowledge and are aware of the safety precautions concerning SARS-COV-2 virus and COVID-19. Majority of non-science major freshmen answered the basic safety questions correctly but were not able to choose the correct answers for the more specific scientific questions concerning SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in basic scientific knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19 between STEM and non-STEM student populations, and first year STEM students were just as knowledgeable as senior STEM students. Based on these data, we speculate that students surveyed here have an acceptable basic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, and therefore, they may not be a source of COVID-19 transmission to Black and Brown communities as this study confirms they are receiving accurate information about SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. Possession of crucial timely and accurate knowledge about the health and safety is important in fighting racism and to gain equity within the society at large. By sharing the acquired knowledge, students can serve as positive role models for others in the community thus encouraging them to pursue science. Education brings equity, sharing the acquired knowledge encourages others to continue their education and succeed in obtaining higher degrees and better jobs as remedies for social inequality. Spread of accurate knowledge on various aspects of COVID-19 will also help remove fears of vaccination and hesitation towards visits to health clinics to resolve health issues. Relying on the results of this pilot study, we plan to explore these important factors further in our next study.","[Emrani, Jahangir; Hefner, Elia Nichelle] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Dept Chem, Greensboro, NC 27410 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University,"Emrani, J (corresponding author), North Carolina A&T State Univ, Dept Chem, Greensboro, NC 27410 USA.",emrani@ncat.edu; enhefner@ncat.edu,,,,,,,56,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-3792,2196-8837,,J RACIAL ETHN HEALTH,J.

We explored the particularities of this phenomenon in the geosciences, via focus groups conducted at STEM professional society meetings, with the goal of informing interventions specific to the discipline. Using grounded theory analysis, two primary drivers for the persistence and perpetuation of gender-based harassment in the geosciences were identified: a particular history of power dynamics and maintenance of dominant stereotypes, and a pattern of ineffective responses to incidents of harassment and discrimination. Informed by intersectional feminist scholarship by women of color that illustrates how efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in STEM without attending to the overlapping impacts of racism, colonialism, ableism, and classism will not succeed, we view harassment and discrimination as structural problems that require collective solutions. Continuing to recruit individuals into a discipline without changing its fundamental nature can tokenize and isolate them or encourage assimilation and acceptance of deep-seated traditions no matter how damaging. It is the responsibility of those in power, and especially those who hold more privileged status due to their social identities, to contribute to the dismantling of current structures that reinforce inequity. By providing explanatory illustrative examples drawn from first-person accounts we aim to humanize the numbers reported in workplace climate surveys, address gaps in knowledge specific to the geosciences, and identify interventions aligned with an intersectional framework that aim to disrupt discriminatory practices endemic to the geosciences and larger STEM community.","[Mattheis, Allison] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Marin-Spiotta, Erika; Nandihalli, Sunita] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Schneider, Blair] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS USA; [Barnes, Rebecca T.] Colorado Coll, Colorado Springs, CO USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Kansas; Colorado College,"Mattheis, A (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",amatthe5@calstatela.edu,"Barnes, Rebecca T/A-2659-2011","Marin-Spiotta, Erika/0000-0001-7343-9354; Mattheis, Allison/0000-0002-8602-3654","U.S. National Science Foundation [HRD1725879, 1726021, 1725650, 1726163, 1725454]; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1725650] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development [1726163, 1726021] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Human Resource Development [1725650] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Division Of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This work was supported by U.S. National Science Foundation Awards HRD1725879, 1726021, 1725650, 1726163 and 1725454 Advance Partnership: From the Classroom to the Field: Improving the Workplace in the Geosciences.",,117,11,12,2,14,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022,17,5,,,,,,,e0268562,10.1371/journal.pone.0268562,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268562,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,3L2RP,35584104,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-30,WOS:000834613800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

White cis men dominate most STEM fields and are particularly overrepresented in positions of status and influence (i.e., full professors, chairs, deans, etc.), positioning them as a potentially powerful demographic for enacting systemic reform. Despite their proclaimed outrage at and interest in addressing inequity, they frequently engage in patterns of belief, speech and (in)action that ultimately support the status quo of white male privilege in opposition to their intentions.ResultsThe white male physicists we interviewed used numerous discourses which support racist and sexist norms and position them as powerless to disrupt their own privilege. We present and discuss three overarching themes, seen in our data, demonstrating how highly educated, well-intentioned people of privilege maintain their power and privilege despite their own intentions: (1) denying inequity is physically near them; (2) locating causes of inequity in large societal systems over which they have little influence; and (3) justifying inaction.ConclusionsDespite being progressively minded and highly educated, these men are frequently complicit in racism and sexism. We end with recommendations for helping cis men engage the power they hold to better work with marginalized people to disrupt inequity.","[Dancy, Melissa] Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI 49006 USA; [Hodari, Apriel K.] Eureka Sci Inc, Oakland, CA USA",Western Michigan University; Eureka Scientific,"Dancy, M (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI 49006 USA.",melissa.dancy@gmail.com,,,,,,,68,2,3,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-7822,,,INT J STEM EDUC,Int.

The conflict stems from the inactivity of the Estonian legislators in regard to hate speech. The violation of the Framework Decision cannot be overcome by interpreting laws. However, the contradiction has been somewhat amplified by the case law of the Estonian Supreme Court. Pursuant to the principle of supremacy of European Union law, the Supreme Court should consider reviewing its interpretation of the ban on hate speech and the danger caused by racist expressions. While even a radical revision would not solve the conflict with European Union law to full extent, a different interpretation could somewhat alleviate the discrepancy. The Ministry of Justice of Estonia has proposed a draft act to amend the ban on incitement to hatred.

Traditionally, Marxist accounts of antiblackness turn, not to Marx's theory of fetishism, but rather to dynamics of class formation under capitalist development, and hence to the ways that class formation motivates types of racism, including antiblackness. But accounts like these do not explain the distinctive features of modern antiblackness. Turning to the Marxist critique of fetishism, I argue for an account of the distinctive features of modern antiblackness, by bringing into conversation: (a) comments by Fanon on negrophobia and the relations between antiblackness and antisemitism; and (b) work by Postone on the fetishistic nature of modern antisemitism. I argue that antisemitism and antiblackness afford a pair of devices for falsely concretising the structure of alienation that produces the apparent opposition of labour and capital. These devices present the pathologies of modernity as stemming not from capitalist social relations but rather from the apparently essential powers of antisocial races: the Jew of antisemitism, caricatured as cunning will without productive bodily expenditure, and the Black of antiblack racism, caricatured as biological energy that lacks self-governing will.","[White, Hylton] Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Anthropol, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"White, H (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Anthropol, Johannesburg, South Africa.",hylton.white@wits.ac.za,,"White, Hylton/0000-0002-0587-3973",,,,,31,12,15,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0253-3952,1940-7874,,SOC DYNAMICS,Soc.

Yet few studies have examined how gendered displays of deference and demeanor are interpreted by college-educated and professional Latinas/os who are making inroads into prestigious and masculinized nontraditional fields such as medicine. In this article, we elucidate how gender shapes perceptions of authority and competence among the same pan-ethnic group, and we use deference and demeanor as an analytical tool to examine these processes. Our analysis underscores three main points of difference: (1) gendered cultural taxation; (2) microaggressions from women nurses and staff and; (3) the questioning of authority and competence to elucidate how gendered racism manifests for Latina/o doctors. Taking demonstrations of gendered deference and demeanors are vital to transforming medical schools and creating more inclusive spaces for all physicians and patients.

Some believe that Trump's success stemmed from the decline of manufacturing and other macroeconomic changes. Others see a political strategy that exploited antagonism towards minorities and immigrants. We put both accounts to the test. Using data from the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) program, we construct a county-level metric of job decline and pair it with a large survey of political and social opinion. Using both logistic regression and random forest classification, we then estimate the impact of economics, race, and other factors on voter choice in 2016. We also perform a what if analysis, predicting how the election would have proceeded had voters experienced greater economic hardship, or harbored more progressive views towards race and immigration. Overall, our research indicates that attitudes towards race and immigration played a significantly larger role in the elections than economics. However, we do find evidence that deteriorating job conditions may have exacerbated the importance of racial views.","[He, Zhaochen] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Econ, Newport News, VA 23606 USA; [Camobreco, John] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Newport News, VA 23606 USA; [Perkins, Keith] Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Phys Engn & Comp Sci, Newport News, VA 23606 USA",,"He, ZC (corresponding author), Christopher Newport Univ, Dept Econ, Newport News, VA 23606 USA.",zhaochen.he@cnu.edu; camobrec@cnu.edu; keith.perkins@cnu.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2432-2717,2432-2725,,J COMPUT SOC SCI,J.

This study fills this research gap by investigating mathematics faculty's perceptions of the significance of race and gender to calculus instruction at a large, public, historically white research university. Methods Theories of colorblind racism and dysconsciousness guided a critical discourse analysis of seven undergraduate calculus faculty's perceptions of instructional events. Findings Our analysis revealed two dominant discourses: (i) Race and gender are insignificant social markers in undergraduate calculus; and (ii) Instructional events can be objectively deemed race- and gender-neutral. We illustrate how calculus faculty varyingly engaged these colorblind discourses as well as discourses that challenged such conceptions of instruction. We also highlight how faculty dysconsciousness in reports of instructional practices reflect potential operationalization of dominant discourses that reinforce colorblind racism. Contribution With limited research on faculty perspectives on racial equity in mathematics, our study documents how color-evasive, gender-neutral discourses among mathematics faculty shape orientations to instruction that reinforce the gatekeeping role of calculus in STEM higher education. Implications are provided for race- and gender-conscious undergraduate mathematics instruction and faculty development.","[McNeill, R.

An implication is that ethnic and racial inequality can be portrayed as something imposed on market systems rather than a routine feature of their functioning.

However, attempts to explain the psychosocial reactions of Black American (BA) men to racial injustice and treat CT must be considered in the context of the current and past structural environments in which they live. The purpose of the present study was to obtain in-depth, thick description of two related factors: BA males' perceptions of injustice during the racial pandemic and the consequent psychosocial implications for theory and treatment. An interview guide addressing racial injustice, CT, and coping was used to conduct individual and focus groups' interviews with 20 BA men. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The qualitative analysis found five themes that collectively fulfilled the study's aims: (1) A violation of the social contract for Black American men, (2) Black American male distrust for police, (3) tripartite Black American male, police fear and heterogeneous emotions, (4) spiritual, technological, appraisal, and relational Black American male coping for racial injustice, and (5) Black American male resilience despite permanence of the racial status quo. As it pertains to BA male racial injustice and the residual CT, the qualitative data suggested multidimensional interventions that are cognitive-behavioral and structural in nature may be worthy of further empirical investigation. From a CT intervention perspective, the five emerging themes can be directly translated into cognitive-behavioral principles regarding therapeutic rapport, cultural adaptation, emphasis on positivity, and collaborative empiricism when working with BA men. Public Policy Relevance Statement Given the complex nature of structural racism and its psychological implications, multilevel interventions are necessary for constructive change. The present study, conducted with Black American men, provides theoretical, clinical, and policy-level implications for addressing cultural trauma and the systemic racism from which is stems.","[Gregory, Virgil L., Jr.] Indiana Univ, Sch Social Work, 902 West New York St,4153, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Tucker Edmonds, Joseph L.] Indiana Univ, Sch Liberal Arts, Indianapolis, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Gregory, VL Jr (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Social Work, 902 West New York St,4153, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",vgregory@iu.edu,,"Gregory Jr., PhD, MSCR, MSW, LCSW, LCAC, Virgil/0000-0002-7991-802X",Indiana University Racial Justice Research Fund,Indiana University Racial Justice Research Fund,Virgil L.

J,"Karlsen, S",,,,"Karlsen, S",,,'Black like Beckham? Moving beyond definitions of ethnicity based on skin colour and ancestry,ETHNICITY & HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,identity; racism; agency; structure; representation; reaction,MINORITY PEOPLE; HEALTH; IDENTITY; WHITES; RACE,"Objectives. The definitions of ethnic status currently employed in, particularly, epidemiological research, tend to focus on skin colour or on perceived historical or ancestral links with certain geographical locations. Neither of these classificatory systems stem from any widely supported theoretical standpoint and their usefulness in terms of explaining any ethnic variation is therefore questionable. In order to enable more informative exploration of ethnicity and its relationship with health and other indicators, a clearer understanding of the processes involved in ethnic identification is required. This paper sets out to explore underlying dimensions which could constitute an ethnic identity across different ethnic groups in England. Design. Principal components factor analyses on the different ethnic groups included in the Ethnic Minority Psychiatric Illness Rates in the Community study: Bangladeshi, Caribbean, Indian, Irish and Pakistani people and a 'white majority' group. Results. In each ethnically specific model, three dimensions of ethnic identity were determined, related to multiculturalism, or the sustenance of ethnic difference, racialisation and community participation. In the ethnic minority group models the 'multiculturalism' dimension formed two factors: one related to the presentation of oneself as a member of a particular ethnic group and one exploring attitudes towards cultural assimilation. The findings suggested that the processes of ethnic identification are similar across the different ethnic (minority and majority) groups explored, but that there may be important differences within any particular group. Conclusion. The recognition of these dimensions of ethnic affiliation provide us with an opportunity to improve our indicators of ethnic status. Each of these dimensions would appear to be important to the lives of people from different ethnic groups in England. These findings also highlight the important role that external attitudes play in the understanding of what it means to be a member of any ethnic group. This aspect of ethnic affiliation has been ignored by current definitions of ethnicity and this imbalance should be redressed.","UCL, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Karlsen, S (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 6BT, England.",s.karlsen@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,20,29,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1355-7858,,,ETHNIC HEALTH,Ethn.

However, recent research shows many conflicts stem from social, economic, and political drivers. We undertook qualitative data collection on livestock farms to determine whether relationships between farmers and their workers affected frequency of reported livestock depredation in Namibia. We found that the conflict was affected by social and economic inequalities embedded in the previous apartheid regime. Macro-and microlevel socioeconomic problems created an environment where livestock depredation was exacerbated by unmotivated farm workers. Poor treatment of workers by farmers resulted in vengeful behaviors, such as livestock theft and wildlife poaching.

We examine the stressors and coping strategies employed by undocumented Latinx immigrants and their families to manage immigration-related stress. We conducted in-depth interviews with 23 immigrant clients at Federally Qualified Health Care Centers (FQHC) in Southeast Michigan and 28 in-depth interviews with staff at two FQHC's and a non-profit agency serving immigrants. Findings suggest that immigrants face heightened anxiety and adverse mental health outcomes because of unique minority identity-related stressors created by a growing anti-immigrant social environment. Chronic stress experienced stems from restrictive immigration policies, anti-immigrant rhetoric in the media and by political leaders, fear of deportation, discriminatory events, concealment, and internalized anti-immigrant sentiment. Though identity can be an important effect modifier in the stress process, social isolation in the immigrant community has heightened the impact of stress and impeded coping strategies. These stressors have resulted in distrust in community resources, uncertainty about future health benefits, delayed medical care, and adverse mental health outcomes. Findings provide a framework for understanding the unique stressors experienced by immigrants and strategies for interventions by social service agencies.","[Valentin-Cortes, Mislael; Benavides, Quetzabel; Lopez, William D.; Fleming, Paul J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bryce, Richard] Community Hlth & Social Serv Ctr, Detroit, MI USA; [Rabinowitz, Ellen] Washtenaw Hlth Plan, Washtenaw Cty Hlth Dept, Ypsilanti, MI USA; [Rion, Raymond] Packard Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Fleming, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",pauljf@umich.edu,,"Fleming, Paul/0000-0001-9150-1254; Valentin Cortes, Mislael/0000-0003-3714-4326",University of Michigan Poverty Solutions Initiative; Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research [UL1TR002240],University of Michigan Poverty Solutions Initiative; Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research,This research was supported in part by grants from University of Michigan Poverty Solutions Initiative and the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (UL1TR002240).

I use ethnographic and publicly available data to examine how Prince George's County, Maryland, a majority-Black and middle-class suburban jurisdiction in the Washington, D.C., region, navigates its financial constraints relative to neighboring counties with smaller Black populations.

In America, that strength can be found in the rich cultural heritage of a diverse nation. Unfortunately, diversity does not permeate all facets of life-specifically in academia and its libraries. The question continues to be asked: where are all of the academic librarians of color? For the ones who are tenured or who are seeking tenure, how can they be retained within the ranks of academia? The focus of this study is to explore and define some of the explicit and implicit barriers faced by academic librarians of color through a review of the literature. Many of the explicit barriers stem directly from racism and from being perceived as the other while implicit barriers are more subtle and stem from the covert damage that toxic environmental forces have on shaping the career and work experiences of librarians of color. This analysis also offers methods for breaking down these barriers (through ways such as mentoring) for institutions to consider along with some strategies to empower librarians of color themselves.","[Riley-Reid, Trevar] CUNY City Coll, Morris Raphael Cohen Lib, Room 2-310,NAC Bldg,160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Riley-Reid, T (corresponding author), CUNY City Coll, Morris Raphael Cohen Lib, Room 2-310,NAC Bldg,160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA.",trileyreid@ccny.cuny.edu,,,,,,,16,10,13,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0099-1333,1879-1999,,J ACAD LIBR,J.

Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews (n = 27) were conducted between June and September 2021. Eligible participants were ethnic Chinese immigrants living in the Boston area, who were recruited through a community-based organization and by word-of-mouth. Interviews were conducted in Mandarin and Cantonese and translated into English. Data were coded and analyzed using a directed approach to content analysis. Results: The majority of participants reported personal experiences of anti-Asian racism, ranging from microaggressions to violent attacks. Although lockdown and isolation during COVID-19 affected all communities, the Chinese community suffered unique and prolonged trauma stemming from the fear of violent attacks against Asians. The older person/people, in particular, were severely isolated due to fear of exposure to anti-Asian hate crimes. Participants reported a variety of emotional, mental, and physical health effects associated with feelings of fear, anxiety, isolation, and powerlessness. Many preferred to engage in self-protective behavior changes rather than relying on external resources. Conclusion: Participants advocated for more education, community, and governmental support, and increased allyship between communities of color. These findings provide cultural context on the trauma this population faces and can inform further actions to address the wide range of reported health effects.","[Chen, Siyu; Dong, Kimberly R.; Tang, Alice M.] Tufts Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02155 USA; [Luo, Yajing; Liang, Shiwei] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Boston, MA USA; [Yau, Yoyo; Hires, Ben] Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Ctr BCNC, Boston, MA USA",Massachusetts Department of Public Health; Tufts University; Tufts University,"Tang, AM (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02155 USA.",alice.tang@tufts.edu,"Liang, Shiwei/GSD-8754-2022","Chen, Siyu/0000-0002-0717-5343",This work was supported by the Tufts University Springboard funding mechanism from the Office of the Vice Provost at Tufts University.; Tufts University Springboard funding mechanism from the Office of the Vice Provost at Tufts University,This work was supported by the Tufts University Springboard funding mechanism from the Office of the Vice Provost at Tufts University.; Tufts University Springboard funding mechanism from the Office of the Vice Provost at Tufts University,The authors would like to thank all of our study participants - your willingness to share your lived experiences and struggles with us made our work possible.r This work was supported by the Tufts University Springboard funding mechanism from the Office of the Vice Provost at Tufts University.,,32,1,1,1,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

These trends are likely fueled by deep-rooted stigma generated from a multitude of origins. Some black women may feel uncomfortable discussing their experience with infertility due to the pervasive stereotype that Black women are hyper-fertile (Ceballo et al Psychol Women Q 39(4):497-511, 20). This stereotype also has important implications within the medical field, in which provider implicit bias may affect referrals and treatment plans, further contributing to stratified reproduction (Chapman et al J Gen Intern Med 28(11):1504-10, 15, FitzGerald and Hurst BMC Med Ethics 18(1):19, 16). It is time for the medical community to shift our focus to what we can change, starting with how we perceive the narrative. In order to effect change, providers should first become and remain aware of racial/ethnic disparities within reproduction. We can make a concerted effort to effectively counsel Black women about their fertility and future childbearing goals, as well as strive to debunk false racial/ethnic fertility stereotypes with medical evidence. We should actively work to understand our biases, where they stem from, and how to resolve them. We must aim to always provide respectful, equitable, and consistent care, especially when deciding how to counsel someone regarding fertility preservation and infertility treatment options. In sum, we can approach solving this complicated racial-ethnic gap in health equity by taking small intentional and parallel steps, starting now.","[Wiltshire, Ashley] NYU, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, Langone Fertil Ctr, 660 1st Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Jackman, Janelle M.] Kindbody Fertil Ctr Silicon Valley, Dept Gynecol & Reprod Hlth, 4756 El Camino Real, Los Altos, CA 94022 USA; [Moreta, Latisha] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Med Genet & Genom, 1428 Madison Ave New York, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Ghidei, Luwam] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA",New York University; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Baylor College of Medicine,"Ghidei, L (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Div Reprod Endocrinol & Infertil, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",lghidei@gmail.com,,"Wiltshire, Ashley/0000-0002-5250-2059; Jackman, Janelle/0000-0002-9141-9207; Ghidei, Luwam/0000-0001-6915-2537",,,,,29,1,2,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1933-7191,1933-7205,,REPROD SCI,Reprod.

This study examined reasons for low vaccination intentions and preferred strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccination. Methods Between November 2020 and March 2021, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 participants who expressed low vaccination intentions in a RAND American Life Panel survey; we also interviewed five stakeholders who represent organizations or subgroups in Black communities that have been highly affected by COVID-19. Results Many interviewees discussed the wait-and-see approach, citing that more time and evidence for vaccine side effects and efficacy are needed. Perceived barriers to COVID-19 vaccination included structural barriers to access (e.g., transportation, technology) and medical mistrust (e.g., towards the vaccines themselves, the government, healthcare providers and healthcare systems, and pharmaceutical companies) stemming from historical and contemporary systematic racism against Black communities. Interviewees also discussed strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccines, including acknowledging systemic racism as the root cause for mistrust, preferred messaging content (e.g., transparent messages about side effects), modes, and access points (e.g., a variety of medical and non-medical sites), and trusted information sources (e.g., trusted leaders, Black doctors and researchers).

These unrecognized contributions include the (often invisible) burdens of mentoring and representation that these scholars bear disproportionately. Here we propose a set of practical steps for writing inclusive, anti-racist tenure letters, including what to do before writing the letter, what to include (and not include) in the letter itself, and what to do after writing the letter to further support the candidate seeking tenure. We are a group of mostly non-Black academics in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) based in the United States who are learning about and working toward Black liberation in academia; we hope these recommendations will help ongoing efforts to move toward an inclusive academia that appreciates and rewards diverse ways of doing, learning and knowing.","[Bellamy, Pearis] Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Haynes, Christy L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Martin, Laura E.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Populat Hlth, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Martin, Laura E.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Hoglund Biomed Imaging Ctr, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Mirabile, Scott P.] St Marys Coll Maryland, Dept Psychol, St Marys City, MD 20686 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Niv, Yael] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rose, Jacqueline K.] Western Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Ross, Rachel A.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurosci, New York, NY USA; [Ross, Rachel A.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Ross, Rachel A.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; Princeton University; Princeton University; Western Washington University; Yeshiva University; Yeshiva University; Yeshiva University,"Bellamy, P (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",pearisbellamy@ufl.edu; chaynes@umn.edu; Lmartin2O@kumc.edu; spmirabile@smcm.edu; yael@princeton.edu; rosej8@wwu.edu; rachel.ross@einsteinmed.edu,"Haynes, Christy L/F-6217-2010","Haynes, Christy/0000-0002-5420-5867; Rose, Jacqueline/0000-0002-3648-8007",,,,,55,0,0,0,4,eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,NOV 15,2022,11,,,,,,,,e79892,10.7554/eLife.79892,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79892,,,10,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,6J2QS,36378159,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-04-30,WOS:000886672700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Disproportionate exposure to ACEs and lack of appropriate responses stemming from systemic racism contributes to racial inequities. Culturally responsive practices and policies focused on early childhood are critical to prevent toxic stress and subsequent health inequities. This paper describes a collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and parents of color with lived experiences of ACEs entitled: Two Generations Thrive, which aims to prevent the intergenerational transmission of ACEs through improving practices and policies within the health care, education, and child welfare systems. Method: Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) and cultural humility provided a framework and key principles for our collaboration, with an emphasis on critical reflection, mitigating power imbalances, and institutional accountability. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to evaluate outcomes. We describe our process of building an infrastructure for bidirectional collaboration and key lessons learned to offer a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and advocates who seek to partner in preventing ACEs and subsequent health inequities. Results: Key lessons learned include: the importance of building and maintaining trust, consistently working to mitigate power imbalances, and the power of bidirectional collaboration to maximize the benefit of research and action for communities traditionally marginalized in research and practice. Conclusions: Cultural humility and CBPR provide a strong foundation to promote bidirectional collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and parents with lived experience of ACEs. Clinical Impact Statement Repeated exposure to adversity can cause toxic stress, which is damaging to physical and mental health. Disproportionate exposure to ACEs and lack of appropriate responses stemming from systemic racism contribute to racial inequities associated with toxic stress including disproportionate intergenerational transmission of ACEs among families of color. This article describes a bidirectional partnership among researchers, practitioners, and parents initially focused on intervention research that grew to focus on building capacity across systems to reduce racial inequities associated with toxic stress.","[Woods-Jaeger, Briana] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav Social & Hlth Educ Sci, Grace Crum Rollins Bldg 526,1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Kleven, Lauren] IMPACT Inc, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Sexton, Chris] Kansas City Ctr Anxiety Treatment, Overland Pk, KS USA; [O'Malley, Donna] Childrens Mercy Hosp, Dept Social Work, Kansas City, MO 64108 USA; [Cho, Bridget] Univ South Carolina Aiken, Dept Psychol, Aiken, SC USA; [Bronston, Sosha; McGowan, Kori; Starr, Debbie] Operat Breakthrough, Kansas City, MO USA",Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; Children's Mercy Hospital,"Woods-Jaeger, B (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav Social & Hlth Educ Sci, Grace Crum Rollins Bldg 526,1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",bwoodsjaeger@emory.edu,,"Woods-Jaeger, Briana/0000-0002-9714-4347; Starr, Debra/0000-0001-9862-2198",David Woods Kemper Foundation,David Woods Kemper Foundation,This research was supported by David Woods Kemper Foundation.,,43,4,5,3,4,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1942-9681,1942-969X,,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

American society believes in harsh sentences for committing crimes without a system for rehabilitation from crime and absent from resources from a community level to prevent crimes. As crime has declined since the 1990s, policing behavior has grown to a level that reflects a disregard for humanity resulting in police-involved shootings, also known as justifiable homicides or deaths by legal intervention. This peculiar problem reifies old notions of racial inferiority and racial profiling that stem from a long history of lynchings in America, and highlights a broken legal system that shows bias toward poor communities and communities not of the racial and ethnic majority. When laws support one racial or ethnic group and those with resources, other communities become invisible and subjected to state-sanctioned violence that allows some police agencies and police officers to engage in behaviors that do not reflect their training foster an overwhelming sense of fear in these communities. We have observed that when communities fear the police and the larger society disbelieves the negative interactions with police, residents have begun to capture police encounters with community members on social media. Despite the video footage that has been collected documenting abuse of power, some police have been granted impunity for their actions, which further fuels fear in these communities. What we propose are ways to frame and solve negative police encounters with communities through an understanding of: (1) racial biases; (2) racial and gender consciousness; (3) ways to provide more equitable policing practices; (4) the enforcement of legal remedies for those who abuse power; and (5) the prevention of acts of discrimination by holding individuals culpable who informally police Black males. We believe these strategies aid in addressing the historical legacy of these behaviors and moves multiple systems and disciplines toward integrated solutions to eliminate justifiable homicides.","[Gilbert, Keon L.] St Louis Univ, St Louis, MO 63103 USA; [Ray, Rashawn; Richards, Joseph B.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Byrd, W.

In the present study, a blog discussion stemming from an editorial about Wasim (Adams, 2008) was analysed. Participants were identified as 'Do-Gooders' and 'Do-Badders'; categories that indicate their orientation to asylum seeker debates (labels originated from the blog itself). We identified several features of the blog discussion. While similar themes and discursive devices were used by the two groups, they were used very differently. The Do-Gooders were more likely to offer accurate information about asylum seekers or Wasim and to show humanitarian concerns for Wasim and others like him. The Do-Badders were more likely to display emotion, show the 'Phillip Adams Effect' (addressing the author of the editorial, Phillip Adams, in their submissions) and name-call. However, there was no significant difference with respect to whether participants addressed Wasim's situation specifically rather than focusing on the general issue of asylum seekers. The blog demonstrates, in microcosm, the divided orientation of Australians regarding asylum seekers.","[Pedersen, Anne] Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University,"Pedersen, A (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",A.Pedersen@murdoch.edu.au; F.Fozdar@murdoch.edu.au,"Fozdar, Farida/L-4803-2013","fozdar, farida/0000-0003-3463-7299",,,,,48,7,7,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1834-4909,,,J PAC RIM PSYCHOL,J.

Borrowing from the latest scholarship on whiteness and/as racial dominance, this article revisits Benito Cerenoto show how Captain Delano's lack of belief in the possibility of a slave insurrection throughout the novella is itself an effect of racism, stemming mostly from the taken-for-granted-ness of white superiority, which Melville shows as distorting the whites' perceptions of blacks. In so doing, I will also explore Ellison's reworking of Melville's racial imagery in Invisible Man, which seems to extend the blindness metaphor to both black and white characters, re-presenting cross-racial blindness as reciprocal rather than unidirectional. As part of this argument, the article posits the inseparability of gender and race, suggesting that Ellison's depiction of white racism may be traced back to the (antebellum) definition of American manhood as free and nonenslaved, which Melville's novella both illustrates and undermines. I thus conclude that Ellison's and Melville's works skilfully anatomize, and critique, the discourses on whiteness and/as masculinity of their respective historical moments, highlighting their interdependence, but also their internal contradictions, which the black characters end up using to their own advantage.","[Armengol, Josep M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Filol Moderna, Fac Letras, Avda Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Armengol, JM (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Filol Moderna, Fac Letras, Avda Camilo Jose Cela S-N, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",josemaria.armengol@uclm.es,"Armengol, Josep/HTN-5806-2023; Carrera, José María M Armengol/T-6429-2017",,,,,,39,2,3,3,19,ASOC ESPANOLA ESTUDIOS ANGLO-NORTEAMERICANOS-AEDEAN,MADRID,"C/O DEPT FILOLOFIA INGLESA I, UNIV COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID, FAC FILOLOGIA, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN",0210-6124,1989-6840,,ATLANTIS-SPAIN,Atlantis-Spain,DEC,2017,39,2,,,,,29,46,,10.28914/Atlantis-2017-39.2.02,http://dx.doi.org/10.28914/Atlantis-2017-39.2.02,,,18,Linguistics; Language & Linguistics; Literature,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Linguistics; Literature,FQ6TZ,,gold,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000418498200002,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Mavelli, L",,,,"Mavelli, Luca",,,Governing the resilience of neoliberalism through biopolitics,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biopolitics; Foucault; governmentality; Greek sovereign debt crisis; neoliberalism; resilience,GLOBALIZATION; CRISIS,"Neoliberalism is widely regarded as the main culprit for the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. However, despite this abysmal failure, neoliberalism has not merely survived the crisis, but actually thrived'. How is it possible to account for the resilience of neoliberalism? Existing scholarship has answered this question either by focusing on the distinctive qualities of neoliberalism (such as adaptability, internal coherence and capacity to incorporate dissent) or on the biopolitical capacity of neoliberalism to produce resilient subjects. This article adopts a different perspective. Drawing on and partially challenging the perspective of Michel Foucault, I argue that neoliberalism and biopolitics should be considered two complementary governmental rationalities, and that biopolitical rationalities contribute to governing the uncertainties and risks stemming from the neoliberalization of life. Biopolitics, in other words, plays a key role in governing the resilience of neoliberalism. Through this conceptual lens, the article explores how biopolitical rationalities of care have been deployed to govern the neoliberal crisis of the Greek sovereign debt, which threatened the stability of the European banking system and, I shall argue, the neoliberal life, wealth and well-being of the European population. The article discusses how biopolitical racism is an essential component of the biopolitical governance of neoliberalism. Biopolitical racism displaces the sources of risk, dispossession and inequality from the neoliberal regime to inferior' populations, whose lack of compliance with neoliberal dictates is converted into a threat to our neoliberal survival. This threat deserves punishment and authorizes further dynamics of neoliberal dispossession.","[Mavelli, Luca] Univ Kent, Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Mavelli, L (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England.",l.mavelli@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,62,44,50,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-0661,1460-3713,,EUR J INT RELAT,Eur.

Utilizing Critical Whiteness Studies and Southern epistemology frameworks, we reconceptualize White Fragility while pulling from this experience and data collected to advance a strategy for confronting Southern White supremacy. Participants included 154 majority White and female students. Data stemmed from document analysis and two years of empirical data drawn from classroom discussions and student assignments. Due to the demographics and location of our college, we utilize the autobiographical demand of place and pay particular attention to understanding the influence of the South on the development of our students' ideology.

That is, the spatial trajectories through which algorithms operate and the distances and differences between the people who develop such algorithms and the users their algorithms affect remain overlooked. Moreover, while the power of big data algorithms has been recently compared to colonialism (Couldry and Mejias 2019), the move from the colonial gaze (Yegenoglu 1998) to the algorithmic gaze (Graham 2010) has yet to be fully discussed. This article aims to fill these gaps by exploring the attempts to algorithmically conceptualize the Other . Based on the case study of an Israeli user-profiling company and its attempts to sell its services to East Asian corporations, I show that the algorithmic gaze-algorithms' ability to characterize, conceptualize, and affect users-stems from a complex combination between opposing-but-complimentary perspectives: that it is simultaneously a continuation of the colonial gaze and its complete opposite. The ways in which algorithms are being programmed to see the Other, the ways algorithmic categories are named to depict the Other, and the ways people who design such algorithms describe and understand the Other are all different but deeply interrelated factors in how algorithms see. I accordingly argue that the story of algorithms is an intercultural one, and that the power of algorithms perpetually flows back and forth-between East and West, South and North.","[Kotliar, Dan M.] Stanford Univ, Deptartment Commun, 450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kotliar, Dan M.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Jerusalem, Israel",Stanford University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Kotliar, DM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Deptartment Commun, 450 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Kotliar, DM (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Jerusalem, Israel.",danmk@stanford.edu,"Kotliar, Dan/HGE-2895-2022","Kotliar, Dan/0000-0001-7028-1678",,,,,112,20,21,1,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0304-2421,1573-7853,,THEOR SOC,Theory Soc.,OCT,2020,49,5-6,,,SI,,919,939,,10.1007/s11186-020-09404-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-020-09404-2,,AUG 2020,21,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,OH9FO,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000564994500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As our understanding of the pathways for viral exposure and associated health outcomes in children evolves, it is critical to consider how changes in the social, cultural, economic, and physical environments resulting from the pandemic could affect the development of children. This review article considers the environments and settings that create the backdrop for children's health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, including current threats to child development that stem from: A) change in exposures to environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, disinfectants, air pollution and the built environment; B) changes in food environments resulting from adverse economic repercussion of the pandemic and limited reach of existing safety nets; C) limited access to children's educational and developmental resources; D) changes in the social environments at the individual and household levels, and their interplay with family stressors and mental health; E) social injustice and racism. The environmental changes due to COVID-19 are overlaid onto existing environmental and social disparities. This results in disproportionate effects among children in low-income settings and among populations experiencing the effects of structural racism.

Through a close reading of the practice of United Nations committees monitoring racism and women's rights from 1993 to 2010, the development of a gradual divergence in their views of legal pluralism is explored.

Results demonstrate that individuals experiencing homelessness die earlier than comparison groups not experiencing homelessness. Methodology and findings varied across studies. Subpopulations included veterans, families, youth, and unsheltered. Causes of death varied across subpopulations and changed over time. Top causes of death, predominantly determined by ICD codes, stemmed from neoplasms, heart disease, and substance use disorder. Sources used for mortality data included the National Death Index (NDI), the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), state death occurrence files, and city vital statistics. Important research foci include standardization, subpopulation variations, policy implications, and the influence of mortality risk factors, such as poverty and racism.","[Funk, Amy M.] Illinois Wesleyan Univ, 1312 Pk St, Bloomington, IL 61701 USA; [Greene, R.

Whilst the definition has received a significant amount of media attention, we are not aware of any comprehensive philosophical analysis. This article analyses this definition. We conclude that the definition and its list of examples ought to be rejected. The urgency to do so stems from the fact that pro-Israel activists can and have mobilised the IHRA document for political goals unrelated to tackling antisemitism, notably to stigmatise and silence critics of the Israeli government. This causes widespread self-censorship, has an adverse impact on freedom of speech, and impedes action against the unjust treatment of Palestinians. We also identify intrinsic problems in the way the definition refers to criticism of Israel similar 'to that leveled against any other country', ambiguous wording about 'the power of Jews as a collective', lack of clarity as to the Jewish people's 'right to self-determination', and its denial of obvious racism. We consider alternative definitions and prefer one like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) definition, 'hostility to or prejudice against Jews', with the addition of the words 'as Jews'. We recognise that the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) can play a useful purpose in illustrating the shortcomings of the IHRA definition. However, we do not advocate promoting it as the prime international definition. Indeed, we question the efficacy of using complex new definitions to combat racism against Jews or other groups, and instead advocate combatting it through collective action across societies.","[Deckers, Jan] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med Educ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Deckers, J (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Med Educ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",jan.deckers@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,1,1,4,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1356-4765,1572-8692,,RES PUBLICA-NETH,Res Publica,DEC,2022,28,4,,,SI,,733,752,,10.1007/s11158-022-09553-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11158-022-09553-4,,MAY 2022,20,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,7B0HW,35578595,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-04-30,WOS:000793674900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on ethnographic observations of client appointments in two pregnancy centers in the West and 29 in-depth interviews with clients, this article uses an intersectional framework to analyze client experiences. Clients favorably compared centers to clinical health care providers, emphasizing the unexpectedly attentive emotional care they received. These evaluations stem from clients' reproductive histories, which are shaped by gender, racism, and economic inequalities that configure their access to and interactions within the health system.

In particular, the exercise of discretion by visa officers is said to allow for racial biases to creep into the decision-making process. By examining visa office approval rates for C50 Federal Skilled Worker and Family Class spouse and partner applications, this paper questions whether decision-making by overseas visa officers who process applications for permanent residence in Canada is racialized. Though visa office and visa category approval rates do in fact vary, the pattern of variation is not consistent with the view that visa officers' work involves stemming the flow of visible minorities to Canada.","McMaster Univ, Dept Sociol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K4, Canada",McMaster University,"Satzewich, V (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Sociol, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K4, Canada.",satzewic@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,29,4,7,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1488-3473,1874-6365,,J INT MIGR INTEGR,J.

In his address and its companion essay, Ewell notes how the repertoire we study and teach, as well as the theories we use to explain it, are manifestations of whiteness. My article will show, first, that the repertory used in the development of theories of harmony and form, as well as (and especially) music theory pedagogy comprises a small, unrepresentative corpus of pieces from the so-called common practice period of tonal music, mostly the music of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and only a small subset of their output. We (mis)use this repertory due to a combination of implicit biases that stem from our enculturation as practicing musicians, explicit biases that stem from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of great composers and particular masterworks, and confirmation biases that are manifest in our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when developing and demonstrating our theories. The theories of harmony and form developed from this small corpus further suffer from overfi ing, whereby theoretical models are overdetermined relative to the broader norms of a musical practice, and from our tendency to conceive of our theoretic models in terms of tightly regulated scripts rather than looser plans. For these reasons, simply expanding our analytic and/or pedagogical canon will do little to displace the underlying aesthetic and cultural values that are bound up with it. We must also address the biases that underlie canon formation and valuation and the methodologies that inherently privilege certain pieces, composers, and repertoires to the detriment of others. It is thus argued that working toward greater equity, diversity, and inclusion in music theory goes hand in hand with addressing some of the problematic methodologies that have long plagued our discipline.","[London, Justin] Carleton Coll, Dept Mus, Northfield, MN 55057 USA",Carleton College,"London, J (corresponding author), Carleton Coll, Dept Mus, Northfield, MN 55057 USA.",jlondon@carleton.edu,,,,,,,51,1,1,1,2,SOC FOR MUSIC THEORY,CHICAGO,"UNIV, CHICAGO, EPT MUSIC, 1010 EAST 59TH STREET, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1512 USA",1067-3040,,,MUSIC THEORY ONLINE,Music Theory Online,MAR,2022,28,1,,,,,,,,,,,,16,Music,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Music,0Q2OI,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000784763000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.","[Van Dusen, Ben; Nissen, Jayson] Calif State Univ Chico, Chico, CA 95929 USA",California State University System; California State University Chico,"Van Dusen, B (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Chico, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",bvandusen@csuchico.edu,"Van Dusen, Ben/CAI-1341-2022","Van Dusen, Ben/0000-0003-1264-0550",Division of Human Resource Development [1525338]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1525338] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"Division of Human Resource Development, Grant/Award Number: 1525338",,78,42,52,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4308,1098-2736,,J RES SCI TEACH,J.

Given the sociopolitical nature of society, schooling, and science education, it is important to address the racist and settled history of scientific disciplines and science education. To this end, we take an antiracist stance on science teaching and learning and seek to disrupt forms of systemic racism in science classrooms. Since teachers do much of the daily work of transforming science education for minoritized learners, we advocate for preparing teachers who understand what it means to engage in antiracist, justice-oriented science teaching. In this article, we share our framework for supporting preservice teachers in understanding, developing, and implementing antiracist teaching dispositions and instructional practices. In alignment with other researchers in teacher education who emphasize the importance of anchoring teacher education practice and research in prominent educational theory, we highlight the theories undergirding our approach to antiracist science teaching.

Post-1968 French neo-polar writers proffer a critical view of contemporary French society with its social inequality, racism, corporate and political corruption, unemployment and its consequences. This paper presents a transatlantic view of contemporary Belleville seen through the eyes of French author and journalist Serge Quadruppani, Canadian artist and author Blaise Giuliani, and American crime fiction writer Cara Black. How do these representations of Belleville differ from one side of the Atlantic to the other? From where do these differences stem? What is the relationship between fact and fiction in each of these portrayals? Does the authors' readership affect the way Belleville is depicted? In attempting to answer these questions, this article contributes to discussions about place and setting in the roman noir/neo-polar, contemporary Belleville, and its reputation in and outside of France.","[Stott, Carolyn] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Stott, C (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,1,LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS,LIVERPOOL,"4 CAMBRIDGE ST, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZU, ENGLAND",0004-9468,2046-2913,,AUST J FR STUD,Aust.

As such, a number of DEI approaches have recently been identified to foster awareness and appreciation of DEI into undergraduate chemistry education. However, in addition to creating DEI awareness, studies or educational approaches whereby undergraduate students are being exposed to some basic DEI knowledge are limited. Hence, in this work, three key DEI initiatives were incorporated into a first semester of Organic Chemistry at a primarily undergraduate institution. The first initiative included a weekly 5-10 min DEI video-discussion activity focusing on building awareness and basic knowledge such as DEI terminology, implicit bias, microaggression, gender, and systemic racism in STEM. The profile of several Black scientists as well as women scientists who have changed the world were also highlighted. The second initiative involved the design of five DEI-based extra credit assignments that connected course content (or concepts) with the historical achievements of a diverse set of chemists. Finally, DEI-based bonus questions were incorporated in three term exams as a formal assessment of student's DEI learning throughout the semester. Pre- and post-DEI-related surveys were conducted, and students' feedback about their DEI learning experiences were overall largely positive. Student scores and answers on the DEI-based activities were analyzed, and the results indicated an increase in the awareness and basic knowledge of DEI in STEM education.","[Sunasee, Rajesh] SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Chem & Biochem, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Plattsburgh,"Sunasee, R (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Chem & Biochem, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA.",rajesh.sunasee@plattsburgh.edu,,"Sunasee, Rajesh/0000-0003-2383-7228",,,,,33,1,1,5,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0021-9584,1938-1328,,J CHEM EDUC,J.

By uncovering certain ambiguities in Changez's ideological rhetoric, the paper tries show how Changez's critique of American corporate fundamentalism stems from his lack of a sense of belonging and from a feeling of problematized identity.","[Ghosh, Avirup] Bhairab Ganguly Coll, English, Kolkata, India",,"Ghosh, A (corresponding author), Bhairab Ganguly Coll, English, Kolkata, India.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,AESTHETICS MEDIA SERVICES-AESTHETIXMS,WEST BENGAL,"AESTHETICS MEDIA SERVICES-AESTHETIXMS, WEST BENGAL, 742225, INDIA",0975-2935,,,RUPKATHA J INTERDISC,Rupkatha J.

This research explored how dominant narratives of Whiteness influence the construction of identity among mixed-race youth in post-apartheid South Africa. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 participants who have one White parent and one parent of colour and were considered 'born frees', as they were born during or after the transition to democracy. Guided by critical race theory, through thematic analysis, three main themes emerged: defying Rainbowism, rejecting Whiteness, and policing identity. Ultimately, this research critically investigates how mixed-race people have constructed their identities while navigating pervasive power structures of White supremacy that continue to shape the rigid racial categorisations in post-apartheid South Africa.","[Metcalfe, Jody] Univ Bayreuth, Fac Languages & Literatures, Dept English Studies & Anglophone Literatures, D-95477 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Metcalfe, J (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Fac Languages & Literatures, Dept English Studies & Anglophone Literatures, D-95477 Bayreuth, Germany.",jodezm@gmail.com,,"Metcalfe, Jody/0000-0001-9537-0589",,,,,34,2,2,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0760,,SOC SCI-BASEL,Soc.

Seemingly aspirational, paths are continuously influenced throughout childhood by both favourable and unfavourable factors. Natural environmental exposures have considerable impacts on development that give rise to transgenerational and community-wide consequences by influencing physical, emotional, and cognitive growth. Each interference can affect academic performance, the ability to reach one's full potential, and ultimately generational social mobility. The ongoing relationship between early development and hindered self-determination is particularly concerning for non-white and low-income communities in the United States, where children experience disproportionately poor environmental conditions. This paper discusses the multi-scalar effects that stem from such exposures to propose environmental justice efforts as the path toward protecting self-determination. Through reviewing human rights, environmental racism, and capability considerations, the paper illustrates how decades of research have cumulated to create a progression toward equity.","[Minaravesh, Bita] Univ Southern Calif, Equ Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Minaravesh, Bita] Univ Southern Calif, Equ Res Inst, 1149 SouthHill St,Suite H340, Los Angeles, CA 90015 USA",University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Minaravesh, B (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Equ Res Inst, 1149 SouthHill St,Suite H340, Los Angeles, CA 90015 USA.",minarave@usc.edu,,"Minaravesh, Bita/0000-0002-5359-9358",,,,,97,0,0,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,1469-6711,,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,SEP 2,2023,28,9,,,,,1097,1111,,10.1080/13549839.2023.2187360,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2023.2187360,,MAR 2023,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Public Administration; Urban Studies,O7YB6,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000946617300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Second, they focus on the school community as a key unit of change, highlighting that radical belonging is a communal experience that stems from collective action. Third, they delineate three essential, interconnected aspects of radical belonging: social belonging, or an ethos of critical care; academic belonging, involving learning that is agentic, culturally and linguistically responsive, collaborative, and anti-hierarchical; and democratic belonging, which engages students, families, and educators in collaboratively developing shared understandings of, and resistance to, white supremacy and interlocking systems of oppression.","[Louie, Nicole; Berland, Leema; Roeker, Laura; Nichols, Kathleen; Pacheco, Mariana; Grant, Carl] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Louie, N (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nlouie@wisc.edu,,"Berland, Leema/0000-0002-1702-6835; Louie, Nicole/0000-0001-6080-325X",Eastwood Elementary School; Madison Education Partnership,Eastwood Elementary School; Madison Education Partnership,The authors wish to acknowledge their partners at Eastwood Elementary School; graduate students Jalessa Bryant and Ana Mireya Diaz de la Guardia; and the Madison Education Partnership for supporting this work.,,72,2,2,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1361-3324,1470-109X,,RACE ETHNIC EDUC-UK,Race Ethn.

These results point to the need for instrument validation to account for item bias and the identification or development of fair research-based assessments.","[Buncher, John B.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Phys, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Nissen, Jayson M.] Nissen Educ Res & Design, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Dusen, Ben Van] Iowa State Univ, Sch Educ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Talbot, Robert M.; Huvard, Hannah] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ & Human Dev, Denver, CO 80217 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo; Iowa State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Buncher, JB (corresponding author), North Dakota State Univ, Dept Phys, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",,"Van Dusen, Ben/CAI-1341-2022","Van Dusen, Ben/0000-0003-1264-0550; Buncher, John/0000-0002-1554-9077",NSF [DUE1928596],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We wish to thank NSF for project funding (DUE1928596).,,31,2,2,0,0,AMER ASSOC PHYSICS TEACHERS,COLLEGE PARK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20740-3845 USA",2377-2379,,978-0-917853-48-7,PHYS EDUC RES CONF,,,2022,,,,,,,69,74,,10.1119/perc.2021.pr.Buncher,http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/perc.2021.pr.Buncher,,,6,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research; Physics,BU2JU,,hybrid,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000885102500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The discourse of colonial criminality stemmed from Japan. s late nineteenth century epistemological commitment to imperialism and concomitant knowledge of law and the legality of colonial subjects. Through an analysis that historicizes the criminal Korean (futei senjin) epithet in the prewar and the emergence of yami as a signifier of Korean economic criminality throughout the 1940s, this article illustrates how the racialization of Koreans in Japan was both framed in terms of crime and subversion, and how that criminality functioned as a justification for postcolonial legalized exclusion and discrimination.","[Matthews, Joel] Surugadai Univ, Dept Contemporary Cultures, Hanno, Saitama, Japan",,"Matthews, J (corresponding author), Surugadai Univ, Dept Contemporary Cultures, Hanno, Saitama, Japan.",,,,,,,,24,2,2,1,5,"KOREA UNIV, CENTER KOREAN HISTORY",SEOUL,"B310, ANAM-DONG 5, SEOUNGBUK-GU, SEOUL, 136-701, SOUTH KOREA",1598-2041,2508-5921,,INT J KOREAN HIST,Int.

Inclusive education has been, inter alia, characterized as a neo-colonial project that is embroiled in and reinforces geopolitical power asymmetries and oppressive regimes. The article suggests that the enduring legacy of colonial perspectives needs to be problematized and challenged through a trauma-responsive lens that captures the traumatizing effects of colonialism/ty on the 'lived' realities of disabled and other disenfranchised groups of students. Trauma is a constituent element of intersectional oppression stemming from and imbricated in conditions of colonial structures of power that conceal and legitimize social inequalities, extreme poverty, malnutrition, violence, substandard childcare, racism, and other 'cultural' traumas. This is an issue that highlights the imperative of developing theories of inclusion that acknowledge and address the intersections of colonialism/ty, disability and trauma and their impact on educational accessibility, participation, and achievement.","[Liasidou, Anastasia] St Marys Univ, Twickenham, England",St Mary's University Twickenham London,"Liasidou, A (corresponding author), St Marys Univ, Twickenham, England.",anastasia.liasidou@stmarys.ac.uk,,"Liasidou, Anastasia/0000-0002-5686-0865",,,,,68,0,0,0,1,STOCKHOLM UNIV PRESS,STOCKHOLM,"STOCKHOLM UNIV LIBRARY, UNIVERSITETSVAGEN 14 D, STOCKHOLM, SE-106 91, SWEDEN",1501-7419,1745-3011,,SCAND J DISABIL RES,Scand.

Yet, workplace violence existed long before the 1980s. This paper investigates three high-profile incidents of workplace violence in the automotive industry of Detroit and Windsor in the 1970s. It explores how these incidents were understood and how such understandings were created and contested, highlighting the pivotal role played by radical legal practice in these contests. It demonstrates that workplace violence often stemmed from factors such as the labour process, racism, and union conflict, and that the success of radical legal practice in raising these issues depended on both the specifics of the crime itself and the political and historical context in which it took place.","Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Milloy, J (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,,,,,,,85,2,3,0,4,CANADIAN COMMITTEE LABOUR HISTORY,ST JOHNS,"MEMORIAL UNIV NEWFOUNDLAND DEPT HISTORY, ST JOHNS, NEWFOUNDLAND A1C 5S7, CANADA",0700-3862,1911-4842,,LABOUR-TRAVAIL,Labour-Trav.,FAL,2014,,74,,,,,51,+,,,,,,39,History; Industrial Relations & Labor,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History; Business & Economics,AU3BA,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000345486700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many scholars believe that the mistrust of health care held by many African Americans stems from a legacy of abuse, from medical experimentation on slaves to the unethical practices with patients in the Tuskegee Syphilis study. We performed a systematic appraisal of the literature, using several key terms, in order to understand how attitudes about HIV-related health care influence African Americans' engagement in care. We examined peer-reviewed studies published during the period January 2001 through May 2012. An initial search generated 326 studies. Sixteen descriptive studies met our inclusion criteria. Experiences of racism, conspiracy beliefs and the quality of provider relationships appeared to impact engagement. Providers should openly investigate personal beliefs that adversely affect their treatment decisions, listen to patient narratives, and share treatment decisions in order to create a transparent environment.","[Gaston, Gina B.] Univ Illinois, Jane Addams Coll Social Work, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Alleyne-Green, Binta] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Social Serv, New York, NY 10023 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Fordham University,"Gaston, GB (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Jane Addams Coll Social Work, 1040 W Harrison St,MC 309, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",ggasto3@uic.edu,,,,,,,70,83,95,0,24,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1090-7165,1573-3254,,AIDS BEHAV,AIDS Behav.,JAN,2013,17,1,,,,,31,40,,10.1007/s10461-012-0323-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-012-0323-x,,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences",073HL,23010941,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000313734000003,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Geronik, A",,,,"Geronik, Arie",,,Israel-UN Relations: Three Phases and Three Questions,ISRAEL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"An in-depth historical examination of relations between Israel and the United Nations reveals three distinct periods. The first (1947-55) was characterized by reciprocal trust and fulfillment of mutual expectations. The second (1956-90) was marked by constant crises, mistrust, and hostility, which peaked with the 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism. The salient feature of the third period (1990 to the present) is a process of normalization with ups and downs. Israel is increasingly regarded by UN members as part of the family of nations, and the attitude towards it has become more balanced. Given the vacillations in UN-Israel relations during the organization's first seventy years, the following three questions may lead to a better assessment of the import of these relations]: A. What provokes so many anti-Israel resolutions and do they stem from anti-Semitism?; B. Does the road to peace necessitate a UN bypass?; C.

We found that all children learned literacies in culturally meaningful contexts that involved stories and hybrid literacy practices, Indigenous foods, religious activities, traditional life skills, Indigenous language, and multiple forms of text. The two city children developed Rukai knowledge and literacies through performance-based contexts, whereas the village children learned through authentic contexts (e.g., observing farming and hunting). The literacy and identity of the two city children may be undermined due to limited access to Rukai resources, stemming from racism, classism, and linguicism.","[Hsin, Ching-Ting; Yu, Chih Ying] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Hsin, CT (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Early Childhood Educ, 521 Nanda Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",cthsin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,"Hsin, Ching-Ting/0000-0002-8880-2571",,,,,49,0,0,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1086-296X,1554-8430,,J LIT RES,J.

To address and remedy these harms, countries and institutions have attempted to create processes for intervention and accountability; however, these efforts have often been limited or unsuccessful. This Article examines two specific efforts: the Justice Reinvestment Initiative in the United States and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. By probing the historical circumstances surrounding the creation of each process and their implementation, the Article analyzes why neither effort achieved their stated aims. That analysis reveals that the failure of these two initiatives stems from a lack of community engagement, narrow conceptions of harm and violence, and the dominance of institutional interests. The Article concludes with examples of campaigns and initiatives that have effectively addressed racial and economic injustices, and the factors that played a role in the success of those efforts.","[Norris, Zachary] Ella Baker Ctr Human Rights, Oakland, CA 94612 USA; [Norris, Zachary] Ella Baker Ctr, Oakland, CA USA",,"Norris, Z (corresponding author), Ella Baker Ctr Human Rights, Oakland, CA 94612 USA.",,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,3,"UNIV DENVER, STURM COLLEGE LAW",DENVER,"2255 E EVANS AVENUE, DENVER, CO 80208 USA",2469-6463,,,DENVER LAW REV,Denver Law Rev.,,2017,94,3,,,,,515,535,,,,,,21,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,EY9JZ,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000404316200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

As part of an evaluation of the study, interviews were carried out with 26 clients of the resource centre. This article presents their perceptions of the service provided and its impact on their lives. The clients' accounts indicate that the resource centre was providing a valued service that was successful in reducing their sense of social isolation, enabling them to address issues of identity and self-worth associated with racism and working with other service providers to better meet their needs.","Kings Coll London, Inst Appl Hlth & Social Policy, London SE1 9NN, England",University of London; King's College London,"Kings Coll London, Inst Appl Hlth & Social Policy, 5th Floor,Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins B, London SE1 9NN, England.",,,,,,,,21,4,5,0,3,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0966-0410,1365-2524,,HEALTH SOC CARE COMM,Health Soc.

Rather, they have changed over time, following the tremendous historical evolutions the Comoro Archipelago has faced. Public policies have played a tremendous role in these changes due to the new rules they set and the resources they allocate.

J,"Forrest, MD",,,,"Forrest, M.",,,Consensus and Crisis: Representing the Poor in the Post-Civil Rights Era,NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FORECLOSURE; EXPERIENCES; INEQUALITY; POLITICS,"The recent financial crisis in the US has stemmed, in part, from the persistent failure of political elites to effectively represent the poor. This article examines this failure, casting it as a matter of discourse. During the post-civil rights era, political elites have directed their efforts on behalf of the poor through a series of consensual discourses. The consensus they enact is, more specifically, between two ascendant traditions: advanced liberalism, focused on achieving the full incorporation of marginalized groups; and colorblind racism, focused on mobilizing formally race-neutral policies and practices. The first part shows how this dominant consensus legitimated the turn to a racially biased neoliberal regime of poverty management. The second part links its influence to the recent financial crisis, focusing especially on how it has, somewhat paradoxically, taken root in the efforts of antipoverty activists. The article concludes by clarifying the importance of imagining and pursuing representative strategies that more directly counter the dominant consensus.","[Forrest, M.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Forrest, MD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0739-3148,1469-9931,,NEW POLIT SCI,New Polit.

Most prominent among the segmental features that the comedians emphasize is the diphthongal variable /ai/. They produce a monophthongal [ A] variant when constructing African American characters and a highly fronted [ai] when portraying the establishment middle class. Characters from both groups appear in situations where their attitudes and behavior highlight the traits attributed to them. African American characters are cast as humanly and culturally rich survivors whose common sense and resilience allow them to make a way out of no way. In contrast, establishment characters appear as narrowly logical, ethnically bland, and ineffectual. The positive portrayal of African Americans is itself a tool of survival that stems from a self-empowering community ideology that serves as a buffer against the effects of perceived racism.","Miami Univ, Linguist Program, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Rahman, J (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Linguist Program, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",,,,,,,,67,21,28,0,4,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",0003-1283,,,AM SPEECH,Am.

We extend Morin's dialogical principle somewhat to address logics that are not part of the same system. The meeting of two processes that stem from different logics and that produce the same behavior has as a consequence, among others, to make it difficult to take completely coherent political positions. Political actors, favoring coherence rather than incoherence, tend to adopt a position of denial when faced with logics that produce meanings that are different from their own. The social conversation becomes then impossible. The principles proposed by Morin make it possible to conceive the necessarily paradoxical aspect of a given social phenomenon and open the door to a more nuanced discussion of the phenomenon.","[Antonius, Rachad] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept sociol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Antonius, R (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept sociol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",antonius.rachad@uqam.ca,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,REVUES ORG,PARIS,"CENTRE SOCIOLOGIE ORGANISATIONS CSO SCIENCES PO-CNRS, 27 RUE SAINT-GUILLAUME, PARIS, 75007, FRANCE",0715-3570,1710-7377,,REV INTERV ECON,Rev.

We conducted a scoping review to identify what is known about barriers to accessing cancer care among Indigenous peoples in Canada (including barriers to accessing cancer services, and barriers to receiving optimal care once those services were accessed), and to identify where along the cancer continuum (screening, diagnosis, treatment, etc.) these barriers are located. We searched SCOPUS, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE for studies published between 1996 and 2019 that examined access to cancer care for Indigenous peoples in Canada; 36 studies were included in our analysis. Our review indicates that Indigenous peoples face barriers to accessing care at the individual level (factors at the level of the individual patient or healthcare provider (HCP) that impede access to cancer care), at the systems level (factors stemming from the healthcare system and its structure), and at the structural level (factors that are embedded within and systematically produced political, historical, social or economic structures). While barriers to accessing cancer care were found throughout the trajectory, there remains a disproportionate focus on access to cancer screening. Moreover, some barriers to accessing cancer care, such as racism, discrimination and lack of culturally safe care, although rooted in structural factors, were inconsistently framed as individual and/or systems factors. This suggests that while there is growing awareness of the impact that racism and discrimination have on access to cancer care at the individual level for example, there remains a lack of understanding of how these issues are linked with systemic and structural issues.","[Horrill, Tara C.; Martin, Donna; Schultz, Annette S.

Gaps in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics pipeline for racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian or Alaska Native, are due in large part to structural racism. Lack of exposure as well as lack of educational, mentorship, and research opportunities contribute to gaps in the dermatology workforce.

Although the centrality of natural history in ecology has shifted over time, natural history is currently in resurgence: many again consider it to be the foundation of ecological and evolutionary inquiry and advocate the value of organism-centered approaches to address contemporary ecological challenges. Educators identify natural history as the foundational entryway into the practice of ecology, for example in the Ecological Society of America's Four-Dimensional Ecology Education (4DEE) framework. A strong natural history foundation can help generate testable hypotheses to refine mechanistic understanding of the drivers regulating species distributions and abundances and to inform restoration and conservation efforts. Given the resurgence of natural history as the foundation for ecological knowledge and practice, it is important to recognize that natural history has a long history of racism that has impacted ecological thought and priorities. This history shapes not only who conducts ecological science but also foundational ecological concepts. For example, natural history's emphasis on pristine nature untouched by humans disregards or appropriates stewardship and knowledge of most of the world's population. Because of the legacy of chattel slavery, this exclusion is particularly strong for people of African descent. This exclusion narrows ecological inquiry, limits the capacity to find solutions to ecological problems, and risks interventions that perpetuate the relation between eugenics, ecological knowledge, and natural systems. If ecology is to become an inclusive, responsive, and resilient discipline, this knowledge gap must be addressed. We here present the colonial and racist underpinnings of natural history and offer strategies to expand inclusion in the study of nature. Natural history was steeped in racism, providing a hierarchy of cultures and a taxonomy of races. Complementing growing interest in traditional and Indigenous ecological knowledge, we focus on Black ecological knowledge, for example in the study of maroon ecologies.  Addressing the racist history of natural history is necessary for removing structural and racist barriers to diverse participation and expanding ecological knowledge bases in service of better and more just science.","[Miriti, Maria N.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rawson, Ariel J.; Mansfield, Becky] Ohio State Univ, Dept Geog, Columbus, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Miriti, MN (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",miriti.1@osu.edu,,"Mansfield, Becky/0000-0003-2120-462X; Rawson, Ariel/0000-0002-4789-3622",U.S. National Science Foundation [2018939]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [2018939] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"U.S. National Science Foundation,Grant/Award Number: 2018939",,140,4,5,4,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Marshalling first-cut empirical evidence from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden, we find patterns of the pandemic's distribution consistent with how the burden of racial and ethnic legacies endures: people from minority communities have worse health and economic outcomes under normal circumstances, inequalities the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated. The comparison shows that the impact of racial and ethnic discrimination on pandemic policy outcomes is not unique to the United States. Health inequalities stemming in part from patterns of institutional racism and discrimination perversely help reproduce these societal inequities.

The political consequences of marginalization, evident in present-day conditions of poverty, stem from the historical and linguistic negation of the African presence in Mexico and its relevance in the country's overall social and political evolution. In national politics, the problem has seldom been engaged because the disparity in wealth distribution is considered a result of the exclusion of the Indian. When Blacks are considered, there is a popular refocusing on Latin American Afro-descendants that folklorizes the other under a fictitious celebratory veil of multiculturalism. This article addresses the socioeconomic dynamics in Black Mexican communities, focusing attention on the burgeoning social movement in the Costa Chica that is addressing issues of invisibility and recognition of el Pueblo Negro in Mexico.

However, it has not been sufficiently inclusive of native English-speaking Black English language teachers (BELTs). Using the method of autoethnography I examine my experiences with emotional labor as I struggle to manage feelings stemming from race-related stress to present feelings that are aligned with the emotional rules of an intensive English program (IEP) in the United States. Ultimately, this study highlights some of the unique challenges and emotional labor experienced by BELTs, including the endured triggering of race-related stress in response to workplace racial microaggression and how and why, through the process of emotional labor, outward responses are constructed. I argue that enduring emotional labor brings about implicit oppressive messages for BELTs to either detach from their racial identity to some extent or to leave their field. Additionally, I provide suggestions for how TESOL programs housed in U.S. higher education contexts can address anti-Black racism.","[Stevenson, Malik] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Stevenson, M (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mss343@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,62,0,0,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0039-8322,1545-7249,,TESOL QUART,Tesol Q.,2023 NOV 15,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/tesq.3274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tesq.3274,,NOV 2023,25,Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; Linguistics,Y0VF7,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:001102525200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A variety of techniques ensured trustworthiness, including data triangulation, member checking, and use of an external interviewer. After data analysis, four core essences emerged: (a) Familial support and formative experiences during childhood, (b) Overload of information and frustration in conducting research, (c) Prejudice and lack of Black representation in the academy, and (d) Change-oriented motivations beset by barriers to access. Findings revealed commonalities in participants' lived experiences that could inform efforts to recruit and retain Black doctoral students, develop curricula that takes into account their experiences and goals, stem systemic racism, and promote equity and inclusion in the academy.","[Hanson, Josef; Roberts, Joel] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN USA; [Hanson, Josef] Univ Memphis, Rudi E Scheidt Sch Mus, Mus Bldg 123B, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Memphis; University of Memphis,"Hanson, J (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Rudi E Scheidt Sch Mus, Mus Bldg 123B, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",josef.hanson@memphis.edu,"Hanson, Josef/AEI-8365-2022","Hanson, Josef/0000-0002-3103-484X; Roberts, Joel/0000-0002-2414-9796",,,,,33,0,0,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1057-0837,1945-0079,,J MUSIC TEACH EDUC,J.

To address these narratives, the course highlighted the contributions of communities of color and other minoritized populations in the historical development of mathematics. It also explicitly challenged dominant constructions of mathematical history and problematized their use to further the power and privilege of particular groups.

Since his murder we have seen Dr King's message of social justice, the growing threat of militarism, the threat the USA's burgeoning empire posed, and his goal of ending injustice boiled down to a few words spoken in Washington DC when he declared his dream to see his children grow up in a society free of race prejudice. This paper engages with Dr King's work and presents a more geographically sophisticated understanding of King's legacy than the oft repeated Washington speech. Through an analysis of Dr King's concept of the Beloved Community, I argue that Dr King's work stems from the experiences of the Black Atlantic world. Consequently, we should see Dr King's social theory as part of a larger anti-colonial struggle which sought to integrate African American and Western notions of community, which holds contemporary importance as a counterpoint to current neoliberal conceptions of community.","Auburn Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Inwood, JFJ (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Geol & Geog, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",jfi0001@auburn.edu,,,,,,,38,31,41,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0066-4812,1467-8330,,ANTIPODE,Antipode,JUN,2009,41,3,,,,,487,508,,10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00684.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00684.x,,,22,Geography,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography,449MT,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000266335400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the context of urban heavy metal contamination and building on previous critiques of the standards, we identified how the ideological commitments of the NGSS hinder their applicability to community issues. We examine latent ideological commitments in the performance expectations (PEs) and disciplinary core ideas as they relate to historical and present causes and consequences of urban heavy metal contamination. Whereas the scientific enterprise and chemical industry produce harms and benefits, the NGSS focus on benefits and ignore that both harms and benefits of science are unevenly distributed. Given the pressure on teachers to implement the NGSS, this paper presents examples from collaborative curriculum development efforts that meet PEs while pushing students to ask critical questions and engage with their communities to challenge the standards' alignment with the chemical industry. Ultimately, we argue that the NGSS position teachers as promoters of the status quo of the scientific enterprise and we document possibilities for the role of science teachers in US schools that are more transformative.","[Morales-Doyle, Daniel; Childress Price, Tiffany; Chappell, Mindy J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Morales-Doyle, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Curriculum & Instruct, 1040 W Harrison St,M-C 147, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",moralesd@uic.edu,,"Morales-Doyle, Daniel/0000-0002-9425-2158; , Mindy J.

A whole range of events have called into question the role of the press in the democratic process in today's combined context of economic crisis and the free reign of market forces. From the publication of the racist cartoons in Denmark, to the Wikileaks witch hunt, to the Leveson inquiry in Britain, the rhetoric of press freedom is revealed as a universalizing concept that masks political and class interest - free expression is not treated universally, but is tied to questions of social, political and economic power. This article argues, however, that it is not the case that liberal democracy has latterly been corrupted or impaired. Instead, the significant limits of liberalism, highlighted by the above instances, stem from the historical conditions which gave rise to it; mass revolution and reaction in the 19th century resulted in constitutional democracies which established the principle of freedom, but not the fact. This article will suggest that from the outset, constitutional democracies were shaped by the class interests of an economic elite. There has been a historic entanglement of emancipation and de-emancipation in liberal thought, and the role of the press in this enterprise has been to use a racially charged definition of freedom and the notion of a threat to our freedoms' to scapegoat the Muslim population and to justify curbing their' freedoms.","[Khiabany, Gholam] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Williamson, Milly] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge U8 3PH, Middlesex, England",University of London; Brunel University,"Williamson, M (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Sch Arts, Film & Televis, Uxbridge U8 3PH, Middlesex, England.",milly.williamson@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,4,5,2,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-3231,1460-3705,,EUR J COMMUN,Eur.

The differences in outcomes arise from not only socioeconomic factors and individual health behaviors but also structural racism. Recent research is beginning to elucidate the benefits of patient navigation to support underserved minoritized individuals who experience this constellation of barriers to equitable care. Qualitative research that utilizes both the experiences of Black birthing individuals and the expert opinion of healthcare providers working with them can serve to guide a patient navigation intervention to further decrease disparities in perinatal outcomes. Methods We conducted 30 interviews between August and December 2020 with Black birthing individuals in the Chicago metropolitan area and healthcare providers who care for this population both in Chicago and across the nation to explore their experiences, perceptions of barriers to care and ways to decrease inequities. Results Clinical care team members acknowledged the presence of health disparities experienced by Black pregnant individuals compared with their NHW counterparts stemming from racism, discrimination, and lack of resources. Patients similarly reported personal experiences with these disparities and barriers to care. The successful methods used by clinical care teams to help decrease these differences in the past included patient education on important topics such as breastfeeding and the use of patient advocates. Effectively screening for social determinants of health by someone the patient trusts was also cited as important. Regarding perinatal care practices, clinical care team members described the importance of patient education needs and care team cultural competency. Patients' reported positive and negative experiences corroborated these findings, emphasizing the importance of trust, listening, education, access to care, support, and patient advocacy. Finally, the care team members and patients agreed that active trust-building can help the provider/patient relationship and ultimately improve outcomes. Conclusions These qualitative research findings improve the understanding of barriers to care and will help guide development of an intervention to reduce the health disparities experienced by Black pregnant persons.","[Alhalel, Jonathan; Patterson, Lane; Francone, Nicolas O.; Danner, Sankirtana; Osei, Cassandra; O'Brian, Catherine Ann; Tom, Laura S.; Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, CHET Ctr Hlth Equ Transformat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Masinter, Lisa; Adetoro, Elizabeth; Ekong, Abbey] Alliance Chicago Network, Chicago, IL USA; [Lazar, Danielle] Access Community Hlth Network, Chicago, IL USA",Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Alhalel, J (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, CHET Ctr Hlth Equ Transformat, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",Jonathan.alhalel@northwestern.edu,,"Lazar, Danielle/0000-0002-1480-8436","National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health [R01MD014068, T37MD014248]; National Institutes of Health's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [UL1TR001422]",National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences,"Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01MD014068 and T37MD014248.

This value-ladenness stems from the historical use of the concept of intelligence in the legitimation of dominance hierarchies. The paper first provides a brief overview of the history of this usage, looking at the role of intelligence in patriarchy, the logic of colonialism and scientific racism. It then highlights five ways in which this ideological legacy might be interacting with debates about AI and its risks and opportunities: 1) how some aspects of the AI debate perpetuate the fetishization of intelligence; 2) how the fetishization of intelligence impacts on diversity in the technology industry; 3) how certain hopes for AI perpetuate notions of technology and the mastery of nature; 4) how the association of intelligence with the professional class misdirects concerns about AI; and 5) how the equation of intelligence and dominance fosters fears of superintelligence.

However, the sustainability of rural spaces as tourism destinations is also challenged by a lack of diversity, including cultural homogeneity, and discrimination against underrepresented groups. Addressing this gap, we used social identity theory to examine how residents' social identities shape their perceptions of inclusivity in rural destinations. We employ a multimethod qualitative study that includes in-depth interviews with residents from four rural destinations. Supplementing these interviews, we ask rural tourists to answer an open-ended questionnaire about their perception of diversity at rural destinations. This study finds that the sustainability of rural destinations is adversely influenced by the processes of social categorization, expressed through intimidation and historical revisionism, and social comparison involving performative allyship that perpetuates covert racism. While linked identity, a crucial pathway within social identification, is vital for fostering inclusive rural tourism environments, complexity rises when residents navigate intragroup conflicts stemming from multiple group identities. This study's originality lies in its in-depth focus on how destination residents construe and contest their rural identity regarding inclusivity and expand on fluidity and intragroup conflict within sustainable rural tourism.","[Soulard, Joelle; Lundin, Emma; Zou, Suiwen Sharon] Univ Illinois, Recreat Sport & Tourism, Urbana, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Soulard, J (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Recreat Sport & Tourism, Urbana, IL 61820 USA.",jsoulard@illinois.edu,"Soulard, Joelle/R-7526-2019","Soulard, Joelle/0000-0003-4453-1770; Zou, Suiwen (Sharon)/0000-0002-9692-240X",University Extension Collaboration Grant - UIUC,University Extension Collaboration Grant - UIUC,This work was supported by the University Extension Collaboration Grant - UIUC,,82,0,0,11,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,1747-7646,,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

We conclude that high rates of diabetes and hypertension among Black Canadians may stem from experiences of racism in everyday life, low rates of heart disease and cancer among Black Canadians may reflect survival bias and low rates of fair/poor mental health among Black Canadian women represent a mental health paradox similar to the one that exists for African Americans in the United States.","[Veenstra, Gerry; Patterson, Andrew C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Veenstra, G (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",gerry.veenstra@ubc.ca,,"Veenstra, Gerry/0000-0001-6917-3784",Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada [G-13-0002797],Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada),This research was funded by a grant awarded to Gerry Veenstra by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (G-13-0002797).,,28,48,53,1,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1557-1912,1557-1920,,J IMMIGR MINOR HEALT,J.

This stems from the fact that Horace's people in this novel undergo an internal colonial experience. In addition, the novel strikingly demonstrates and resembles various aspects of anti-colonialism. To challenge internal colonialization, the novel presents two aspects of anti-colonial agency: negation and affirmation. Negation is used to destabilize the colonial racist subjectivity, and affirmation is employed to construct an alternative postcolonial subjectivity. In all of its breadth, Horace's transformative discourse is rendered through three phases: economic empowerment and independence, educational fulfilment and progress, and political participation and representation. My contention is that Horace's challenge to racism is part of a larger umbrella of challenging colonialism and imperialism. Moreover, I am driving at dialogic intersectionality of African American liberating thought and anti-colonial discourse, as demonstrated by Horace's novel. As I am concerned throughout with analysing the institutionalized and systematized racist ideology implemented by white racist people to subjugate black Americans, I also scrutinize Horace's anti-colonial and anti-slavery discourse.","[Al-Jarrah, Hamzeh A.] Taibah Univ, Coll Arts & Humanities, Dept English, Yanbu 41411, Saudi Arabia",Taibah University,"Al-Jarrah, HA (corresponding author), Taibah Univ, Coll Arts & Humanities, Dept English, Yanbu 41411, Saudi Arabia.",hajarrah@taibahu.edu.sa,,"Al-Jarrah, Hamzeh A./0000-0002-2270-1188",,,,,29,0,0,1,1,UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,SELANGOR,"SERDANG, SELANGOR, 00000, MALAYSIA",0128-7702,2231-8534,,PERTANIKA J SOC SCI,Pertanika J.

To estimate the cumulative probability (c) of arrest by age 28 years in the United States by disability status, race/ethnicity, and gender. Methods. I estimated cumulative probabilities through birth cohort life tables with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997. Results. Estimates demonstrated that those with disabilities have a higher cumulative probability of arrest (c = 42.65) than those without (c = 29.68). The risk was disproportionately spread across races/ethnicities, with Blacks with disabilities experiencing the highest cumulative probability of arrest (c = 55.17) and Whites without disabilities experiencing the lowest (c = 27.55). Racial/ethnic differences existed by gender as well. There was a similar distribution of disability types across race/ethnicity, suggesting that the racial/ethnic differences in arrest may stem from racial/ethnic inequalities as opposed to differential distribution of disability types. Conclusions. The experience of arrest for those with disabilities was higher than expected. Police officers should understand how disabilities may affect compliance and other behaviors, and likewise how implicit bias and structural racism may affect reactions and actions of officers and the systems they work within in ways that create inequities.","[McCauley, Erin J.] Cornell Univ, Policy Anal & Management, Coll Human Ecol, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University,"McCauley, EJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Martha Van Rensselaer Hall,37 Forest Home, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ejm354@cornell.edu,,"McCauley, Erin/0000-0001-7648-437X",,,,,13,18,31,1,14,AMER PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC INC,WASHINGTON,"800 I STREET, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-3710 USA",0090-0036,1541-0048,,AM J PUBLIC HEALTH,Am.

The relationships they establish with the surrounding society are constituted by a complex and dynamic network of rules and conventions that go beyond the individual and determine them with intensity. When confronted, they produce discursive methods and strategies to guarantee the acquisition of another language and their own existence. The aim of this study is to analyze how two indigenous women, Wai-wai (PA) and Apinaye (TO), express power and resistance in discursive and social practices to ensure knowledge and the acquisition of a second language. This is a study with a focus on Critical Discourse Analysis, based on approximations with the Post-Colonial and Decolonial theoretical currents, with regard to epistemological criticism. The results show that linguistic factors cannot be understood in isolation from social clashes, since violence, racism, prejudice and intolerance against indigenous women stem from the degree of difference and power relations between cultures and languages. It is evident in their social and discursive practices a place of position of power and resistance, mobilized by the needs of social insertion.","[de Padua Cancio, Raimundo Nonato] Univ Fed Tocantins UFT, Tocantins, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Tocantins (UFT),"Câncio, RND (corresponding author), Univ Fed Tocantins UFT, Tocantins, Brazil.",nonato.cancio@uft.edu.br,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,"UNIV ESTADUAL PARANA, ESCOLA MUSICA & BELAS ARTES PARANA",CURITIBA,"RUA COMENDADOR MACEDO 254, CURITIBA, PR 80060-030, BRAZIL",2238-6084,,,REV EDUC LING,Rev.

Many of the factors associated with tumour progression and immune resistance, such as yin yang (YY)1 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3 beta, regulate acetyl-CoA and the melatonergic pathway, thereby having significant impacts on the dynamic interactions of the different types of cells present in the tumour microenvironment. The association of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) with immune suppression in the tumour microenvironment may be mediated by the AhR-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1-driven 'backward' conversion of melatonin to its immediate precursor N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS within tumours and released from tumour microenvironment cells activates the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, TrkB, thereby increasing the survival and proliferation of cancer stem-like cells. Acetyl-CoA is a crucial co-substrate for initiation of the melatonergic pathway, as well as co-ordinating the interactions of OXPHOS and glycolysis in all cells of the tumour microenvironment. This provides a model of the tumour microenvironment that emphasises the roles of acetyl-CoA and the melatonergic pathway in shaping the dynamic intercellular metabolic interactions of the various cells within the tumour microenvironment. The potentiation of YY1 and GSK3 beta by O-GlcNAcylation will drive changes in metabolism in tumours and tumour microenvironment cells in association with their regulation of the melatonergic pathway. The emphasis on metabolic interactions across cell types in the tumour microenvironment provides novel future research and treatment directions.","[Anderson, George] Clin Res Commun CRC Scotland & London, Eccleston Sq, London SW1V 6UT, England",,"Anderson, G (corresponding author), Clin Res Commun CRC Scotland & London, Eccleston Sq, London SW1V 6UT, England.",anderson.george@rocketmail.com,"Anderson, George/AEO-3626-2022","Anderson, George/0000-0001-7243-0817",,,,,230,28,29,1,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Religion is often an important support for students of color who are navigating a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics culture that privileges White nonreligious students. For instance, religion helps mitigate the negative effects of racism, but religious students are also more likely to experience conflict when learning evolution. In this nation-wide study, we examined the extent to which strong religiosity among students of color can explain their lower evolution acceptance. We surveyed students in 77 college biology courses across 17 states and found that Black/African American students tend to be more religious and less accepting of evolution than any other racial/ethnic identity group and that Hispanic students tend to be slightly more religious and slightly less accepting of evolution than White students. Importantly, we find that religious background is an important factor associated with Black and Hispanic students' lower levels of evolution acceptance. This study suggests that the biology community should become more inclusive of Christian religious students if it wishes to foster inclusive evolution education for Black and Hispanic students.","[Barnes, M.

They are linguistically profiled within the space based on how they sound. Specifically, Latina women within the space experience nativism, racism, sexism, and even heterosexism as many identify as sexual minorities. African-American women experience racialized sexism stemming from the duality of their ascribed identities. The women within the study have responded by segregating from the larger gaming community and have created their own clans (similar to guilds) and game with other women. The purpose of the clans depends on the type of oppressions experienced by the women within the space.

In addition, researchers continue to investigate the root causes of the high teacher turnover observed in many low-income, high-minority schools and whether this is due more to school demographics or poor working conditions. Purpose: This article examines New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) teachers' risk of leaving their first school in their first 9 years. It both describes the patterns in leaving and examines how school demographics and school climate predict these leaving patterns. Participants: The study follows 608 teachers: two cohorts of secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers who entered the classroom in New York City in 2006 or 2007. Research Design: This is a quantitative study of survey and retention data that were collected as part of a longitudinal research project on NYCTF mathematics teachers. Data Analysis: We use an event history analysis (including a life table and hazard function graphs) to describe patterns in teachers' timing of leaving their first school. We also use a discrete time hazard model to estimate the relative relationships between the predictors of interest (school demographics and school climate) and teacher turnover. Results: The findings from this study provide evidence against the general hypothesis in the field that teachers leave their first schools at the highest rate during their first 1 to 3 years. Second, we also found that the turnover of alternatively certified teachers who began in low-income, high-minority urban schools was driven by both student demographics and school climate conditions, including teacher collegiality and student behavior. Third, we found evidence to support our hypothesis that teachers' individual perceptions of their school environment are stronger drivers of their turnover compared with the perceptions of their colleagues. Conclusion: The results from this study add to our understanding about the timing of teacher turnover among secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers, illustrating that teacher turnover may remain higher later in beginning teachers' careers than currently assumed. This suggests that teachers in Years 3 to 5 in their careers may be good targets for supports. Our findings support the theory that improving school climate can help retain teachers but also provide a cautionary tale for a complete focus on school climate; stemming teacher turnover may require addressing larger economic forces (e.g., the global trend toward temporary work) and more insidious social forces, such as structural racism and inequality.","[Grant, Ashley A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Res & Reform Educ, Baltimore, MD USA; [Brantlinger, Andrew M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Teaching & Learning Policy & Leadership, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Johns Hopkins University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Grant, AA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, 300 E Joppa Rd,5th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21286 USA.",agrant27@jhu.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) [1535251]; Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1535251] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF #1535251): The Career Trajectories of Urban Mathematics Teachers From a Selective Alternative Certification Program.",,73,3,9,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

It outlines site and area options to build climate resilience, strengthen community action for dismantling structural racism and disinvestment, and reduce the disproportionate risks experienced by communities of colour and areas of low income. The authors propose a new research agenda to address the gaps identified.","[De Sousa, Christopher] Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Carroll, Ann M.

This crisis has attracted intense media attention. Recently, some media outlets inappropriately labelled the coronavirus by race, using such headlines as Chinese virus pandemonium and even suggesting China kids stay home. The biased and misleading coverage presented via Western media channels has incited anger throughout the Chinese community and has placed undue stress upon Chinese individuals living outside China. This post-published review takes a tourism-focused perspective to examine findings from a quantitative study (Rodriguez-Seijas, Stohl, Hasin, & Eaton, 2015) published in 2015 in JAMA Psychiatry. The current paper highlights the potential impacts of misleading and biased media coverage on Chinese individuals' mental health. Specifically, this work considers perceived racial discrimination stemming from coronavirus as a public health crisis and the effects of such discrimination on individuals of Chinese heritage. Similarly imperative are pertinent effects on country image and destination image with respect to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during times of crisis. By considering racism in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, this paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in tourism and hospitality.","[Wen, Jun; Aston, Joshua] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia; [Liu, Xinyi] Sichuan Univ, Coll Tourism, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ying, Tianyu] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Tourism & Hotel Management, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Edith Cowan University; Sichuan University; Zhejiang University,"Wen, J (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia.",j.wen@ecu.edu.au,"liu, xinyi/GWZ-8739-2022; Wen, Jun/AAC-3537-2019","Wen, Jun/0000-0002-1110-824X; Aston, Joshua/0000-0002-7850-081X",,,,,29,136,148,0,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1303-2917,2156-6909,,ANATOLIA,Anatolia,APR 2,2020,31,2,,,SI,,331,336,,10.1080/13032917.2020.1730621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13032917.2020.1730621,,FEB 2020,6,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,LO8XB,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000515432800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the context of feminist, anti-fascist, and queer rights activism in Greek culture and society, this analysis discusses how poetry that exposes femicide and queer violence challenges the provisions of both Greek law and the universality of human rights. Stemming from post-human feminist and queer critiques of dominant ethno-patriarchal structures, poetry becomes a medium of collective mourning, public commemoration, and justice-seeking for victims of hate crime, homophobia, racism, and misogyny. For the past decade, such interventions have reinforced the formation of a counter-archive of poetry responding to the aftermath of violence and hatred levelled at LGBTQ communities, women, and immigrants in Greece. Aiming at rendering visible the lives and deaths of victims of gender-based violence such as Zak Kostopoulos/ Zackie Oh, Eleni Topaloudi, and Vaggelis Giakoumakis, this article seeks also to examine how the horizon of poetry can be reformulated as one of social sustainability that interrogates the crisis of biopolitical survival.","[Remoundou, Natasha] Natl Univ Ireland, Moore Inst, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Remoundou, N (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Moore Inst, Galway, Ireland.",tasharem@hotmail.com,,,,,,,87,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1752-1483,1752-1491,,LAW HUMANITIES,Law Humanities,JAN 2,2022,16,1,,,,,28,58,,10.1080/17521483.2022.2075177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17521483.2022.2075177,,JAN 2022,31,Law,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Government & Law,3I3DT,,hybrid,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000798122600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contrary to what Wilson's and Ogbu's work sometimes imply, inner-city blacks are not enmeshed in a culture of poverty, but rather are generally committed to mainstream values and their normative expectations. Activities that deviate from these values derive from the cognitive expectations inner-city blacks have formed in the face of their restricted legitimate opportunity structures. These expectations, which suggest that educational and occupational success are improbable for inner-city residents, are accurate. If their opportunities were to improve, their cognitive expectations would change and most would be committed to taking advantage of these new opportunities. The differences that separate the inner-city poor from whites center on cultural symbols, which help constitute their identity, sometimes in opposition to the white majority. Most deficiencies in performance among blacks stem not from these cultural attributes, but from the way they are processed in white-dominated organizations. Given a majority commitment to equal opportunity and a majority belief that blacks actually have equal opportunity, many conclude from their performance that blacks are in some sense inferior. This new racism  overdetermines the performance of blacks.","Haverford Coll, Dept Sociol, Haverford, PA 19041 USA",Haverford College,"Gould, M (corresponding author), Haverford Coll, Dept Sociol, Haverford, PA 19041 USA.",,,,,,,,97,35,62,0,10,BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS,MALDEN,"350 MAIN STREET, STE 6, MALDEN, MA 02148 USA",0735-2751,,,SOCIOL THEOR,Sociol.

Overturning Roe v Wade allowed the divided individual states to independently decide the legal parameters regarding abortion care. A decision that disproportionately effects the reproductive lives of women residing on the land of America. Given the systemic impacts of racism, neoliberalism and white supremacy, it is the Black, racialized and poor women who suffer terrible repercussions. In this commentary the authors begin by discussing the historical biopolitical perspective, colonial systems and longstanding impacts on racialized women's bodies in America. The discussion transitions to the implications of geopolitics at play nationally and cascading impacts globally, focusing on humanitarian and emergency settings. Using a medical humanities perspective, authors highlight the collision between politics and reproductive health policy and its implications on social determinants of health, such as women's education, employment, housing, racial and gender equity and wellbeing. Long standing advocates, community leaders and healers, leading scientists, birth attendants, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals/providers and humanitarian workers - and many others - are reminded and live the weight of the continuous battle of population control, stemming from the oppressive history of control and exploitation.","[Coen-Sanchez, Karine] Univ Ottawa, Sch Sociol & Anthropol Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Ebenso, Bassey] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, England; [El-Mowafi, Ieman Mona] NORImpact, Stavanger, Norway; [Berghs, Maria] De Montfort Univ, Sch Allied Hlth Sci, Unit Social Study Thalassaemia & Sickle Cell, Leicester, England; [Idriss-Wheeler, Dina] Univ Ottawa, Interdisciplinary Sch Hlth Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Yaya, Sanni] Univ Ottawa, Fac Social Sci, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Yaya, Sanni] Imperial Coll London, George Inst Global Hlth, London, England",University of Ottawa; University of Leeds; De Montfort University; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Imperial College London,"Yaya, S (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Fac Social Sci, Sch Int Dev & Global Studies, 120 Univ Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.;Yaya, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, George Inst Global Hlth, London, England.",sanni.yaya@uOttawa.ca,"Yaya, Sanni/C-1079-2019; Ebenso, Dr. Bassey E./H-5536-2017","Yaya, Sanni/0000-0002-4876-6043; Ebenso, Dr. Bassey E./0000-0003-4147-0968; Coen-Sanchez, Karine/0000-0002-3272-819X; Idriss-Wheeler, Dina/0000-0003-1767-2471; Berghs, Maria/0000-0002-6512-7921; El-Mowafi, Ieman/0000-0002-5635-4022",,,,,32,18,20,3,34,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1742-4755,,REPROD HEALTH,Reprod.

By delineating economic, educational and family relations as belonging respectively to conscious, subconscious and nonconscious spheres he asserts that different family types produce distinctive sets of values that account for person's nonconscious preference for liberty versus authority, inequality versus equality etc. According to Todd to each type of family corresponds a particular ideology, political regime, religion etc. Thereby French sociologist provides original and rather unexpected insights into many social phenomena namely predisposition to liberalism, social democracy, communism, racism, xenophobia etc. Of a particular value is his elucidation of the anthropological roots of individualistic (American-type or absolute nuclear family) and coordinated (German and Japanese or stem family) capitalisms that sheds a new light on supposedly rather well documented story of the varieties of capitalism. However, in economic matters Todd is not always at his best. By describing homo economicus as a conscious but always acting in a framework of particular nonconscious family values, he somewhat blurs distinction between of conscious and nonconscious. In fact, he seems to have never been precise as to which - individual (personal) or collective (societal) - nonconscious family values modify person's economic performance. As he sharply criticizes Germany for imposing a stem family (austerity) type economic policy on EC, one may deduce that they interact at least at a national level. French thinker's theory critically depends on the thesis of an exceptional longevity of nonconscious family values, seemingly a rather questionable idea however supported by evidence. Even accelerating atomization of societies making family values' influence more subtle does not undermine the validity of this his central thesis. Todd' works are not without flaws but they are highly provocative, original and pathbreaking.","[Studentsov, Viktor B.] Russian Acad Sci IMEMO, Primakov Natl Res Inst World Econ & Int Relat, 23 Profsoyuznaya Str, Moscow 117997, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy & International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Studentsov, VB (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci IMEMO, Primakov Natl Res Inst World Econ & Int Relat, 23 Profsoyuznaya Str, Moscow 117997, Russia.",studentcov.viktor@gmail.com,"Studentsov, Viktor/C-9842-2019","Studentsov, Viktor/0000-0002-4242-0877",,,,,29,0,0,0,0,NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE,MOSCOW,"PROFSOYUZNAYA UL 90, MOSCOW, 117864, RUSSIA",0131-2227,,,MIROVAYA EKON MEZHD,Mirovaya Ekon.

Worse health outcomes can be attributed to a variety of barriers to healthcare specific to this population, but scant literature exists that presents the connections among them. Many of these barriers to healthcare stem from institutional racism, disparities in socioeconomic status, and xenophobia. To synthesize barriers that hinder the Hispanic/Latinx population from receiving quality healthcare, we propose a cyclical model. The model begins with obstacles present before even visiting a healthcare provider, including structural inequalities, cultural beliefs, documentation status, scheduling, and transportation. Next, the model poses barriers during the visit with a healthcare provider, including problems with provider bias, cultural barriers, and interpretation services. Finally, the model presents barriers that occur after the medical encounter, including payment, medication adherence, indigent care, and follow-up appointments or referrals. Once the patient needs to schedule a follow-up appointment or referral, the cycle restarts with the barriers present before accessing care. All of these barriers to healthcare are areas for potential mitigation of the healthcare disparities that currently disadvantage the Hispanic/Latinx population. The proposed Hispanic Cyclical Healthcare Barrier (HCHB) model helps organize solutions to the barriers, illustrating the need for multiple interventions due to the interconnectedness of the barriers.","[Brener, Samantha; Jiang, Stephanie; Hazenberg, Emma; Herrera, Daniel] Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912 USA",University System of Georgia; Augusta University,"Brener, S (corresponding author), Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912 USA.",sbrener@augusta.edu; stjiang@augusta.edu; ehazenberg@augusta.edu; dherrera@augusta.edu,,"Brener, Samantha/0000-0003-3643-7258",,,,,61,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-3792,2196-8837,,J RACIAL ETHN HEALTH,J.

However, little is known about whether racial bias predicts ingroup health outcomes among minority populations. Objective: The aim of the current research was to understand whether racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes for Blacks. Method: We compiled racial bias responses from 250,665 Blacks and 1,391,632 Whites to generate county-level estimates of Blacks' and Whites' implicit and explicit biases towards each other. We then examined the degree to which these biases predicted ingroup death rate from circulatory-related diseases. Results: In counties where Blacks harbored more implicit bias towards Whites, Blacks died at a higher rate. Additionally, consistent with previous research, in counties where Whites harbored more explicit bias towards Blacks, Whites died at a higher rate. These links between racial bias and ingroup death rate were independent of county-level socio-demographic characteristics, and racial biases from the out-group in the same county. Conclusion: Findings indicate that racial bias is related to negative ingroup health outcomes for both Blacks and Whites, though this relationship is driven by implicit bias for Blacks, and explicit bias for Whites.

Furthermore, structural limitations in Canadian federal government data contribute to the lack of comparative rates of COVID-19 between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. To make visible Indigenous Peoples' experiences in the public health discourse in the midst of COVID-19, this paper aims to answer the following interrelated research questions: (1) What are the associations of key social determinants of health and COVID-19 cases among Canadian health regions? and (2) How do these relationships relate to Indigenous communities? As both proximal and distal social determinants of health conjointly contribute to COVID-19 impacts on Indigenous health, this study used a unique dataset assembled from multiple sources to examine the associations among key social determinants of health characteristics and health with a focus on Indigenous Peoples. We highlight key social vulnerabilities that stem from systemic racism and that place Indigenous populations at increased risk for COVID-19. Many Indigenous health issues are rooted in the historical impacts of colonization, and partially invisible due to systemic federal underfunding in Indigenous communities. The Canadian government must invest in collecting accurate, reliable, and disaggregated data on COVID-19 case counts for Indigenous Peoples, as well as in improving Indigenous community infrastructure and services.","[Huyser, Kimberly R.; Jessome, Mary G.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Horse, Aggie J.

Data were collected over the course of their seventh-grade year in both in school (science classroom) and out-of-school (afterschool club) contexts. The Multidimensionality of Black Girls' STEM Learning framework was used to explore the role of the afterschool club as a counterspace and how students made sense of science, science people, and their current and future selves based on their experiences in school and after school science contexts. All three participants struggled to see their future selves as scientists and made distinctions amongst being a science person, a person who likes science, or a scientist. They also negotiated views of science as active and hands-on in the afterschool setting while experiencing more passive and decontextualized forms of science in the formal school setting. Implications include a need to disrupt the culture of science and reimagine formal science education by learning from out-of-school time science programs that function as counterspaces to support Black girls' science identity. We conclude that there remains a need to draw attention to and understand the role of race and racism in science education so that Black girls' science identities are affirmed beyond counterspaces.","[Wade-Jaimes, Katherine] Univ Nevada, 4505S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [King, Natalie S.; Schwartz, Renee] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Wade-Jaimes, K (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, 4505S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",Katie.wade-jaimes@unlv.edu,,"Schwartz, Renee/0000-0002-8244-2579; King, Natalie/0000-0002-4465-1409; Wade-Jaimes, Katherine/0000-0001-9392-0946",,,,,65,18,21,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-8326,1098-237X,,SCI EDUC,Sci.

Concretely, it investigates the potential of the latter ???the curatorial practices??? of producing more inclusive and egalitarian sociocultural representa-tions through the so-called curatorial activism. In line with the counter-hegemonic actions that have been taking place in the context of feminist struggles since the beginning of the century in Latin America, this piece focuses on the issue of race or ethnicity, which is an intrinsic dimension of the colonial matrix of power and the decolonial thought developed in the continent. After a historical-theoretical survey of the low representation of women and particularly of women of colour in art history, it addresses the concepts of intersectionality, coloniality of gender, epistemic and institutional racism, and curatorial activism. The article examines the implications of the articulation of curatorial activism and decoloniali-ty of gender through the analysis of two curatorial projects in Latin America. These expose the existence of curatorial strategies that are socially engaged with diversity and actively counteract the continued underrepresentation, silencing and neglect of the history still suffered by many artists and women of colour, which glances at a movement towards the decolonization of epistemologies, knowledge and, of course, aesthetics.",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,UNIV DIEGO PORTALES,SANTIAGO,"REPUBLICA 180, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-2309,,,REV 180,Rev. 180,,2022,,50,,,,,81,81,,10.32995/rev180.Num-50.(2022).art-1045,http://dx.doi.org/10.32995/rev180.Num-50.(2022).art-1045,,,1,Architecture,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Architecture,8L9CU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-30,WOS:000924076700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students. We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from. first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions. Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus getup Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twenty-three participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using open-ended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently. Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings. Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs. The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt. The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them. Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal.","[McGee, Ebony O.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Divers & STEM Educ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Griffith, Derek M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Res Mens Hlth, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Houston, Stacey L., II] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University Peabody College; Vanderbilt University; George Mason University,"McGee, EO (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Divers & STEM Educ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",,"Griffith, Derek/L-4987-2017; McGee, Ebony Omotola/F-1747-2016","Griffith, Derek/0000-0003-0018-9176;",,,,,76,47,66,3,63,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

Many studies have linked societal biases against the mathematical abilities of women and people of color to this underrepresentation, as well as to earlier measures of mathematical confidence and performance. Recent studies have shown that teachers may unintentionally have biases that reflect those in broader society. Yet, many studies on teachers' reports of students' abilities use data in the field-not experimental data-and thus often cannot say if the findings reflect bias or actual differences. The few experimental studies conducted suggest bias against the abilities of girls and students of color, but the prior work has limitations, which we seek to address (e.g., local samples, no exploration of moderators, no preregistration).MethodsIn this preregistered experiment of 458 teachers across the U.S., we randomly assigned gender- and race-specific names to solutions to math problems, then asked teachers to rate the correctness of the solution, as well as the student's math ability and effort. Teachers also completed scales reflecting their own beliefs and dispositions, which we then assessed how those beliefs/dispositions moderated their biases. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nested data structure.ResultsConsistent with our preregistered hypotheses, when the solution was not fully correct, findings suggest teachers thought boys had higher ability, even though the same teachers did not report differences in the correctness of the solution or perceived effort. Moreover, teachers who reported that gender disparities no longer exist in society were particularly likely to underestimate girls' abilities. Although findings revealed no evidence of racial bias on average, teachers' math anxiety moderated their ability judgments of students from different races, albeit with only marginal significance; teachers with high math anxiety tended to assume that White students had higher math ability than students of color.ConclusionsThe present research identifies teachers' beliefs and dispositions that moderate their gender and racial biases. This experimental evidence sheds new light on why even low-performing boys consistently report higher math confidence and pursue STEM-namely, their teachers believe they have higher mathematical ability.","[Copur-Gencturk, Yasemin] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Thacker, Ian] Univ Texas San Antonio, San Antonio, TX USA; [Cimpian, Joseph R.

These groups exist in both urban streetscapes and rural communities; all have come to represent a new culture of transgressive resistance in a state that has never completely dealt with issues of political legitimacy or extensive poverty, creating a deviant form of 'liquid modernity' which provides the space for such groupings to exist. The article demonstrates that the prevailing ideology in contemporary, post-downturn Ireland have created the conditions for incidents of 'cultural criminology' that at times erupt into episodes of counter hegemonic governmentality. The article further argues that these groups which have emerged may represent the type of transgressive Foucaultian governmentality envisaged by Kevin Stenson, while they are indicative of subcultures of discontent and nascent racism which belie the contented findings of various affluence and contentment surveys conducted during the years of rapid growth. The paper develops this theme of counter-hegemonic 'governmentality', or the regional attempts to challenge authorities by local groups of transgressors. The paper finally argues that, in many ways, the emergence of a culture of criminality in the Irish case, and media depictions of the same, can be said to stem from the corruption of that country's elites as much as from any agenda for resistance from its beleaguered subcultures.","Inst Technol, Sligo, Ireland",Munster Technological University (MTU),"Leonard, L (corresponding author), Inst Technol, Sligo, Ireland.",liam_leonard@yahoo.com,,,,,,,37,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1205-8629,1572-9877,,CRIT CRIMINOL-NETH,Crit.

This essay provides an overview of this inequity and identifies how a scientific society can catalyze representational, structural, and interactional diversity to achieve greater inclusion. Needed changes go beyond representational diversity and require an intentional commitment to build capacity through inclusivity and community engagement by supporting anti-racist policies and actions. We want to realize a sense of belonging on the part of scientists in society at large and enable research pursuits through a lens of social justice in service of coastal communities. Minimally, this framework offers an avenue for increased recruitment of individuals from more diverse racial and ethnic identities. More broadly, the mechanisms described here aim to create a culture in scientific societies in which social justice, driven by anti-racist actions, produces systemic change in how members of scientific societies approach, discuss, and address issues of inequity. We have written this essay for members of the coastal and marine science community who are interested in change. We aim to call in new voices, allies, and champions to this work.","[Harris, L.

An Intersectional Analysis in a Southern Brazilian Population,SOCIOLOGY OF RACE AND ETHNICITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brazilians; discrimination; intersectionality; race; class; gender,,"Despite ideals of equality and racial democracy, high levels of social inequality persist in contemporary Brazil. In addition, while the majority of the Brazilian population acknowledges the persistence of racism, high proportions of socially disadvantaged groups do not regard themselves as victims of discrimination. This study seeks to shed light on this issue by investigating the processes through which individuals come to interpret their experiences of mistreatment as discrimination. We ask: (1) How frequently do respondents perceive being treated differently due to a variety of social statuses alone and in combination? and (2) What factors are associated with respondents interpreting this differential treatment as discrimination? Data come from an ongoing cohort investigation, which included a representative sample of adults living in the urban area of Florianopolis. Results show that 45 percent of respondents experienced mistreatment and attributed it to two or more factors, such as social class, age, gender, and race. Perceptions of mistreatment based on social class were positively correlated with perceived mistreatment due to gender, place of residence, weight, race, and the way one dresses. Regression analyses revealed that interpreting differential treatment as stemming from multiple social statuses was the strongest predictor of respondents classifying their mistreatment as discrimination. Our findings highlight the importance of disentangling perceptions of mistreatment from perceptions of discrimination and show that the relationship between the two is structured in large part by the ways in which individuals interpret their experiences at the intersection of multiple inequalities.","[Bastos, Joao L.; Bernardo, Carla O.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Publ Hlth, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Harnois, Catherine E.] Wake Forest Univ, Sociol, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Peres, Marco A.] Univ Adelaide, Populat Oral Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Paradies, Yin C.] Deakin Univ, Race Relat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Wake Forest University; University of Adelaide; Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance; Deakin University,"Bastos, JL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Saude Publ, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",joao.luiz.epi@gmail.com,"Bernardo, Carla/F-2909-2015","Bernardo, Carla/0000-0001-6998-6419","Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [485327/2007-4, 508903/2010-6]; CNPq [303857/2015-3]",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The EpiFloripa Study was sponsored by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), grant numbers 485327/2007-4 and 508903/2010-6.

To do so, it examines how the white working class residents of Love Canal, New York, claimed health and a healthy environment as rights of citizenship. To date, the Canal has remained a sore spot for environmental scholarship; this article demonstrates how the analytic difficulties posed by the Canal stem from the crosscurrents of American political culture in the late 1970s. Canal residents put their local experience into several larger frames of reference: the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, the plight of Cuban and Vietnamese refugees, and a culture of skepticism toward government and medical authority. Residents' use of these frameworks illustrates two broader points about American political culture in the late 1970s. First, the claim to health as a right rather than a privilege, articulated by health radicals throughout the 1960s, had by the late 1970s been decoupled from its origins in left-liberal struggles. Second, the crosscurrents of localism, nativism, racism, and anti-authoritarianism characteristic of the reactionary populism of urban working-class whites could, quite logically for their proponents, co-exist with rights-based claims to health and a healthy environment. Love Canal demands that we embed our narratives about the development of environmental politics-environmental justice in particular-within a broader story about deregulation, the rise of the New Right, and the political and economic marginalization of the working class in the United States.","[Thomson, Jennifer] Bucknell Univ, Dept Hist, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Thomson, J (corresponding author), Bucknell Univ, Dept Hist, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",jct021@bucknell.edu,,,,,,,91,0,0,1,65,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-4529,1527-1897,,J SOC HIST,J.

These forces marginalize populations and create the circumstances that disadvantage these groups, as reflected in differences in outcomes like life expectancy and infant mortality and in inequitable access to and delivery of health care resources. To help eradicate these inequities, physicians must understand racism, sexism, oppression, historical marginalization, power, privilege, and other sociopolitical and economic forces that sustain and create inequities. A new educational paradigm emphasizing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to achieve health equity is needed. Systems-based practice is the graduate medical education core competency that focuses on complex systems and physicians' roles within them; it includes topics like multidisciplinary team-based care, patient safety, cost containment, end-of-life goals, and quality improvement. This competency, however, is largely health care centric and does not train physicians to engage with the complexities of the social and structural determinants of health or to partner with systems and communities that are outside health care. The authors propose a new core competency centered on health equity, social responsibility, and structural competency to address this gap in graduate medical education. For the development of this new competency, the authors draw on existing, innovative undergraduate and graduate medical pedagogy and public health, health services research, and social medicine frameworks. They describe how this new competency would inform graduate medical education and clinical care and encourage future physicians to engage in the work of health equity.","[Castillo, Enrico G.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles Cty Dept Mental Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Castillo, Enrico G.; Braslow, Joel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Jane & Terry Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Ctr Social Med & Humanities,Dept Psychiat & Biobe, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Isom, Jessica] Codman Sq Hlth Ctr, Dorchester, MA USA; [DeBonis, Katrina L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Jane & Terry Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jordan, Ayana; Rohrbaugh, Robert] Yale Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT USA; [Jordan, Ayana] Community Mental Hlth Ctr, New Haven, CT USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Yale University,"Castillo, EG (corresponding author), UCLA, Jane & Terry Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, 760 Westwood Plaza,Semel B7-435, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",egcastillo@mednet.ucla.edu,"Braslow, Joel/AAG-9564-2021; Castillo, Enrico/AAH-1862-2019","Braslow, Joel/0000-0002-6830-2991; Castillo, Enrico/0000-0002-3807-1125",National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Science UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute [UL1TR000124],National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Science UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute,This project received support from the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Advancing Translational Science UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute (grant number UL1TR000124).,,50,41,45,1,18,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-2446,1938-808X,,ACAD MED,Acad.

Specifically, neighborhood ethnic-racial concentration may support or inhibit ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development or content; it may amplify or mitigate exposure to discrimination stemming from racism. It is important to consider factors that may explain mixed findings given study, neighborhood, and adolescent characteristics may be sources of systematic heterogeneity. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effects of neighborhood ethnic-racial concentration on discrimination and ERI among Black, Asian American, and Latinx adolescents. The search initially retrieved 162 records; 13 met inclusion criteria and were coded for theoretical and design elements. A total 36 associations were identified (discrimination: k = 16; ERI: k = 20). For discrimination, a majority of the associations (56%) were in the promoting direction, such that higher neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations of Blacks, Asian Americans, and Latinxs were associated with less discrimination for Black, Asian American, and Latinx adolescents, respectively. For ERI, 35% of the associations were promoting, such that higher neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations of Blacks, Asian Americans, and Latinxs were associated with more positive ERI outcomes for the same groups. Almost all of the remaining findings for discrimination were null (38%) and all remaining findings for ERI (65%) were null. This systematic review documents how higher neighborhood ethnic-racial concentrations are potentially beneficial to within-group adolescents navigating the development of ERI and discrimination.","[Pasco, Michelle C.; White, Rebecca M.

These include the accelerated rate of climate change, pandemic threats, systemic racism, growing health and social inequities, and the regulation of new technologies to ensure an equitable future 'for all.' In nursing codes of ethics, administration, education, policies, and practice, social justice is often claimed to be a core value, yet it is rarely contextualized by philosophical or theoretical underpinnings. It appears that nurses' commitment to social justice may stem more from a penchant for 'doing good' than an attempt to explore, understand, and enact what is meant by social justice from an ontological, epistemological, and methodological perspective. We contend that the dominance of a human science perspective in nursing contributes to a narrow definition of health and relegates many issues central to social justice to the margins of nurses' care. In this article, we explore how the focus on 'the human' in the human science perspective may not only be limiting the capacity of nurses to develop strategies to adequately address social injustice, but in some instances, direct nurses to contribute to their very reproduction. We suggest that a critical interrogation of this human-centric hegemony can identify avenues of rupture and introduce posthumanism as an additional philosophical perspective for consideration to help bridge the human-social divide.","[Adam, Simon; Juergensen, Linda; Mallette, Claire] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Adam, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",siadam@yorku.ca,,"Adam, Simon/0000-0002-3043-3013",,,,,59,12,12,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-7681,1466-769X,,NURS PHILOS,Nurs.

In health and physical activity, Chinese people are often represented and positioned differently to other (minority) ethnic groups. For example, Black young people are often understood as having low academic motivations and aspirations but as natural' athletes; in contrast, Chinese young people, seen as the model minority' who excel in STEM subjects, are fragile, reserved and disinterested in physical movements. These public forms of representation may sit in opposition to the young people's embodied identity. When these misrepresentations are internalised, issues such as micro-aggression and racism may have an impact on Chinese young people's health and wellbeing. This paper aims to examine how Chinese bodies are gendered and racialised in contemporary social media sites (e.g. Google News, LiveJournal, Medium, Wordpress). Drawing on critical discourse analysis and Foucault's concepts of normalisation and discursive practice, the paper will problematise the often taken-for-granted gendered and racialised stereotypes related to Chinese physicality and health on social media sites. Implications for developing future research and teaching resources in critical media health literacy for young people on issues related to gender and equity will be provided. The results affect how we understand, represent, and discuss Chinese (young) people on social media sites, thereby how Chinese young people engage, construct, and perform their embodied identities in Western, English speaking societies.","[Pang, Bonnie] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Inst Culture & Soc, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Hill, Joanne] Univ Bedfordshire, Inst Sport & Phys Act Res, Bedford, England",Western Sydney University; University of Bedfordshire,"Pang, B (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Sch Sci & Hlth, Inst Culture & Soc, Penrith, NSW, Australia.",B.Pang@westernsydney.edu.au,"Pang, Bonnie/C-3229-2008; Hill, Joanne/L-2615-2013","Hill, Joanne/0000-0001-5107-5043; /0000-0003-2763-4321",,,,,61,4,5,4,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1357-3322,1470-1243,,SPORT EDUC SOC,Sport.

We find that BLM protests dramatically amplify the use of terms associated with the BLM agenda throughout the movement's history. Longitudinal data show that terms denoting the movement's theoretically distinctive ideas, such as systemic racism, receive more attention during waves of protest. We show that these shocks have notable impact beyond intense, or viral, periods of nationwide protest. Together, these findings indicate that BLM has successfully leveraged protest events to engender lasting changes in the ways that Americans discuss racial inequality.","[Dunivin, Zackary Okun; Rojas, Fabio] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Dunivin, Zackary Okun; Yan, Harry Yaojun] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp Sci, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Yan, Harry Yaojun] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ince, Jelani] Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Dunivin, ZO (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Dunivin, ZO (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp Sci, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",zdunivin@iu.edu,"Dunivin, Zackary/HII-6014-2022","Yan, Yaojun/0000-0002-9499-360X; Ince, Jelani/0000-0003-2897-2189","Racial Justice Research fund at Indiana University; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Grant [1735095]; Racial Justice Research Fund at Indiana University, Bloomington; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1735095] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Racial Justice Research fund at Indiana University; National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Grant; Racial Justice Research Fund at Indiana University, Bloomington; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","We thank the Racial Justice Research fund at Indiana University for sponsoring this work.

In this paper I explain this scholarly neglect as stemming from three factors. First, disciplinary parochialism has blinded US sociologists to the complex interweaving of enslavement with the systems of oppression that sociology has decided to care about. Second, presentism, an ahistorical account of the past that culminates in a preference for present-day events and institutions, has relegated slavery to history. Finally, theoretical frameworks that revise enslavement as ennobling erase the long-term effects of psychological and physical violence on the descendants of enslaved peoples.","[Patterson, Orlando] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, William James Hall 520, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Patterson, O (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, William James Hall 520, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",pattersonorlando@gmail.com,,,,,,,62,10,15,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0304-2421,1573-7853,,THEOR SOC,Theory Soc.,DEC,2019,48,6,,,SI,,903,914,,10.1007/s11186-019-09369-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-019-09369-x,,DEC 2019,12,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,KJ3RZ,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000500867300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this longitudinal study, adolescents and their parents reported their individual and structural attributions for race achievement gaps and parents' racial socialization.

This essay, bearing in mind the broader national and global dynamics, focuses on the Veronese context by describing the path of a project involving the University of Verona, local partners and some young asylum seekers from West Africa with sartorial skills, and a Kurdish artist. The research project stems from the need, felt as pressing in the historical and political framework we are living through, to restore the centrality and narrative capacity to refugees' individual experiences, namely to take their history away from the media's sweeping generalizations in order to return it to the subjective dimension, where the visions of the world and the knowledge embedded in the preceding life path might become tools for social inclusion and recognition in the arrival countries. The choice decided upon was that of bringing the anthropological gaze and creative process into a dialogue by shaping the artifact-blankets crafting into an articulated 'doing together', and thus configuring it as a moment for reflecting upon the complex question of 'wounds' - material and immaterial - regarding the migration journey and present everyday life. The artifact-blankets along with ethnographic and visual materials have been displayed in an exhibition. The narrative style that the two authors have deliberately chosen for this essay is the outcome of negotiations, which makes it a hybrid writing.","[Paini, Anna; Varvarica, Sabaudin] Univ Verona, Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Varvarica, S (corresponding author), Univ Verona, Verona, Italy.",anna.paini@univr.it; sabaudin.varvarica@univr.it,"Paini, Anna/ABC-5861-2020",,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,ETHNOREMA ASSOC,SCRIVIA,"VIA BELLINI 19, CASTELNUOVO, SCRIVIA, AL 15053, ITALY",1826-8803,,,ETHNOREMA,Ethnorema,,2021,,17,,,,,1,31,,10.23814/ethn.17.21.pai-var,http://dx.doi.org/10.23814/ethn.17.21.pai-var,,,31,Linguistics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Linguistics,5C7TC,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000864457200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Approximately 52 per cent of Indigenous peoples in Canada live in urban areas. In spite of high rates of urbanization, urban Indigenous peoples are overlooked in health care policy and services. Because of this, although health care services are more plentiful in cities as compared to rural areas, Indigenous people still report significant barriers to health care access in urban settings. This qualitative study, undertaken in Prince George, Canada, examines perceived barriers to health care access for urban Indigenous people in light of how colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples in their everyday lives. The three most frequently reported barriers to health care access on the part of the 65 participating health care providers and Indigenous clients of health care services are: substandard quality of care; long wait times; and experiences of racism and discrimination. These barriers, some of which are common complaints among the general population in Canada, are interpreted by Indigenous clients in unique ways rooted in experiences of discrimination and exclusion that stem from the settler colonial context of the nation. Through the lenses of cultural safety and ethical space frameworks developed by international Indigenous scholars in efforts to better understand and operationalize relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and societies in the context of settler colonialism this study offers an understanding of these barriers in light of the specific ways that colonialism intrudes into Indigenous clients' access to care on an everyday basis.","[Nelson, Sarah E.; Wilson, Kathi] Univ Toronto Mississauga, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga,"Nelson, SE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto Mississauga, 3359 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",sarah.nelson@mail.utoronto.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Population Health Intervention Research Network; University of Toronto, Mississauga, Canada; Royal Canadian Geographical Society","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Population Health Intervention Research Network; University of Toronto, Mississauga, Canada; Royal Canadian Geographical Society","Funding was provided to the first author through a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council doctoral fellowship and a Population Health Intervention Research Network doctoral fellowship as well as travel and research funding from the University of Toronto, Mississauga, Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.",,61,49,57,4,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-9536,,,SOC SCI MED,Soc.

The life course perspective posits that poorer outcomes of Black birthing people stem from heightened exposure to stressors early in life and cumulative exposure to stressors over time. Despite its prominence, this perspective has seldom been investigated empirically. We analyzed longitudinal data gathered from 1319 women in low-income households in Wisconsin who received perinatal home visiting services. Variable- and person-centered analyses were performed to assess whether 15 adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and 10 adverse adult experiences (AAEs) were associated, alone and in combination, with pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and low birth weight among Hispanic (i.e., Latinx) and non-Hispanic Black and White participants. As expected, there were disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight, and both ACEs and AAEs were linked to poorer pregnancy and birth outcomes. Unexpectedly, bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that the associated effects of ACEs and AAEs were most robust for non-Hispanic White women. A latent class analysis produced four patterns of life course adversity, and multigroup latent class analyses confirmed that, compared to White women, higher-adversity class assignments were associated with less robust effects for Hispanic women, and even less robust effects for Black women. We discuss interpretations of the paradoxical findings, including the possibility that alternative sources of stress such as interpersonal and structural racism may better account for the reproductive disparities that disproportionately affect Black birthing people.","[Mersky, Joshua P.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Helen Bader Sch Social Welf, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Mersky, Joshua P.; Lee, ChienTi Plummer; Gomez, Anthony] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Inst Child & Family Well Being, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Jeffers, Noelene K.] Johns Hopkins Sch Nursing, Baltimore, MD USA; [Shlafer, Rebecca J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Pediat, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Jackson, Dylan B.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Gomez, Anthony] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Social Welf, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Johns Hopkins University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mersky, JP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Helen Bader Sch Social Welf, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.;Mersky, JP (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Inst Child & Family Well Being, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",mersky@uwm.edu,,"Gomez, Anthony/0000-0002-7815-7345","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources Services Administration [X10MC43618, X10MC33618]","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources Services Administration","This work was supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources Services Administration (X10MC43618 ; X10MC33618).",,93,0,0,3,5,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-3792,2196-8837,,J RACIAL ETHN HEALTH,J.

Bi + identities alone are often rendered invisible, unintelligible or erased when it comes to inclusion and solidarity among their peers. An intersectional lens is used to reflexively investigate existing literature to explore how a lack of solidarity among lateral communities may impact Aboriginal bi + people in Australia who face an array of racism and queerphobia from both LGBTQ + and Aboriginal communities. These unique and multifaceted layers of discrimination greatly impact mental health and wellbeing. These experiences stem from the heterosexist and monosexist status quo from heteropatriarchal settler colonialism that is seen in both Aboriginal and LGBTQ + communities respectively. As a result, Aboriginal queer people are constantly surveying risks, policing their own identities and identity expression, often hiding parts of their identity as a survival strategy to avoid rejection and adhere to dominant cultural norms. When specifically considering Aboriginal bi + identities, there are added unique stressors of lateral violence with other LGBTQ + groups, antibisexual prejudice, and assumed monosexuality, adding additional layers of minority stress. The author explores these experiences by extending upon borderland theory and minority stress models. Whilst there is solace in the holistic celebration of intersecting identities in emerging intersectional Aboriginal queer spaces, there is still a great need for solidarity and celebration of Aboriginal bi + people within the broader LGBTQ + community.","[Henningham, Mandy] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Henningham, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",mandy.henningham@sydney.edu.au,,"Henningham, Mandy/0000-0002-0080-4370",,,,,72,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1089-4160,1540-3548,,J LESBIAN STUD,J.

This research aimed to understand the specific barriers to health care that Indigenous patients and their families face, as well as to explore promising practices and strategies for improving the responsiveness of health services to the needs of Indigenous people. Through qualitative interviews with Indigenous and non-Indigenous health care and social services providers, we identified a range of challenges and successful approaches, and developed recommendations for improving policy and practice to address the gaps in culturally safe health care services. Our study shows that many of the barriers Indigenous people face when accessing health care are rooted in the broader social determinants of health, such as poverty, racism, housing, and education. These are complex problems that are outside of the traditional scope of health care practice. However, this study has also demonstrated that many barriers to equitable care actually stem from within the health care system itself. We found that health care gaps were often attributable to poorly funded on-reserve health care services and culturally unsafe off-reserve services. Attitudes and practices among those working in health care and gaps in coordination between mainstream and Indigenous services are challenges related to the way the health care system operates. Solutions are needed that address these issues.

The roots of these disparities stem from different extrinsic and intrinsic forces that guide career development. Efforts to ameliorate African American underrepresentation in academic medicine have traditionally focused on modifying structural and extrinsic barriers through undergraduate and graduate outreach, diversity and inclusion initiatives at medical schools, and faculty development programs. Although essential, these initiatives fail to confront the unique intrinsic forces that shape career development. America's ignoble history of violence, racism, and exclusion exposes African American physicians to distinct personal pressures and motivations that shape professional development and career goals. This article explores these intrinsic pressures with a focus on their historical roots; reviews evidence of their effect on physician development; and considers the implications of these trends for improving African American representation in academic medicine. The paradigm of race-conscious professionalism is used to understand the dual obligation encountered by many minority physicians not only to pursue excellence in their field but also to leverage their professional stature to improve the well-being of their communities. Intrinsic motivations introduced by race-conscious professionalism complicate efforts to increase the representation of minorities in academic medicine. For many African American physicians, a desire to have their work focused on the community will be at odds with traditional paths to professional advancement. Specific policy options are discussed that would leverage race-conscious professionalism as a draw to a career in academic medicine, rather than a force that diverts commitment elsewhere.","[Powers, Brian W.] Harvard Med Sch, 250 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Powers, Brian W.] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA; [White, Augustus A.] Harvard Med Sch, Med Educ & Orthopaed Surg, Boston, MA USA; [Oriol, Nancy E.] Harvard Med Sch, Students, Boston, MA USA; [Oriol, Nancy E.] Harvard Med Sch, Anesthesia, Boston, MA USA; [Jain, Sachin H.] CareMore Hlth Syst, Cerritos, CA USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Powers, BW (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, 250 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",brian_powers@hms.harvard.edu,,,,,,,17,26,32,0,9,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1040-2446,1938-808X,,ACAD MED,Acad.

I employ autoethnography and counterstorytelling as methods that center my multiple identities and lived realities as I document my racialized and gendered experiences in relation to my journey to Ferguson, MO and my experiences as a secondary ELA teacher. The research questions guiding this study are the following: (I) As a Black male English educator and language and literacy scholar, how am I implicated in the struggle for racial justice and what does it mean for me to teach literacy in our present-day justice movement?; (2) How are Black lives mattering in ELA classrooms?; and, (3) How are we using Black youth life histories and experiences to inform our mindset, curriculum, and pedagogical practices in the classroom? This article explicates findings from three interconnected stories that work to show how CREE can be operationalized to better understand the #BlackLivesMatter movement in its historical and contemporary dimensions. The data analyzed stem from my autobiographical narratives, observations, social media artifacts, and images. I aim to expand English education to be more synergistically attuned to racial justice issues dealing with police brutality, the mass incarceration of Black people, and legacies of grassroots activism. This analysis suggests implications that aim to move the pedagogical practices around the intersections of anti-blackness and literacy from the margins to the center of discussion and praxis in ELA contexts.","[Johnson, Lamar L.] Michigan State Univ, Language & Literacy Linguist & Racial Divers, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Johnson, LL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Language & Literacy Linguist & Racial Divers, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,,67,42,83,1,6,NATL COUNCIL TEACHERS ENGLISH,URBANA,"1111 KENYON RD, URBANA, IL 61801 USA",0034-527X,,,RES TEACH ENGL,Res.

Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in prevalence, severity, and management of OAB, presenting care barriers for marginalized patients. We aim to explicate these disparities and explore the factors that led to their existence and persistence. We will additionally offer suggestions to mitigate such disparities and approach equitable care for our patients. Methods This is a narrative review of pertinent articles related to health disparities in OAB. Articles on OAB prevalence stratified by race and ethnicity, and variations in treatment patterns for patients of marginalized backgrounds were identified from the PubMed database. We also included a review of evidence from governmental and historical sources to provide sociocultural context. Results Patients from marginalized backgrounds are underrepresented in OAB literature. There appear to be differences in symptom severity and prevalence based on race. OAB severity seems closely entwined with social determinants of health. Patients from marginalized populations experience numerous care barriers impeding the treatment of OAB. Finally, White patients are more likely to receive advanced management for OAB. Conclusions Numerous health disparities exist in the diagnosis and management of OAB. This review is grounded in societal context: health injustice in the United States ultimately stems from systemic racism. Improving our understanding of care disparities and the systems that allow them to persist will bring us closer to equity and allow our patients from marginalized backgrounds to obtain the evidence-based care they deserve.","[Roselli, Nicole; Halani, Priyanka K.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, 111 E 210th St, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Mckay, Elishia] Maimonides, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Nauheim, Jennifer; Abraham, Nitya E.] Montefiore Med Ctr, Dept Urol, 1250 Waters Pl,Tower 1 PH, Bronx, NY 10461 USA",Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Montefiore Medical Center; Maimonides Medical Center; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Montefiore Medical Center,"Abraham, NE (corresponding author), Montefiore Med Ctr, Dept Urol, 1250 Waters Pl,Tower 1 PH, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",nabraham@montefiore.org,,"Roselli, Nicole/0000-0001-9992-5772; Abraham, Nitya/0000-0002-8304-4388",,,,,35,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0733-2467,1520-6777,,NEUROUROL URODYNAM,Neurourol.

Although the causes are multifactorial, the mental health system poorly serves those at highest risk of criminal legal system involvement. The growth of the mental health evidence base regarding the social determinants of mental health has ushered in greater understanding of their central role in the promotion and maintenance of mental illness and health. These academic strides, however, have failed to translate into widespread care and payment policy changes. Additionally, as is the case in the criminal legal system, structural racism shapes people's experiences in the mental health care system, contributing to inequitable mental health outcomes for persons with severe mental illness from racial and ethnic minority groups. This is a critical consideration for the population involved in the criminal legal system: Black and Brown people make up more than half of those incarcerated in the United States (despite comprising just 32% of the total population). In the absence of an intersectional, antiracist, structurally informed approach, any attempt by the mental health care system to stem the overrepresentation of people with serious mental illness in the criminal legal system will fail. This article provides an overview of the current mental health care system's shortcomings in serving this population. It proposes concrete steps to address these shortcomings, with a special focus on race and social determinants of health.

How could a champion of Brazil's 'racial democracy' and a pioneer of historiographical hybridism, like Freyre, express anti-Semitic stereotypes imbued with racialist overtones? This article aims to give some answers to this riddle through a textual and contextual analysis of Freyre's masterpiece: Masters and Slaves (Casa Grande & Senzala, 1933). After reviewing past scholarship on this issue (mostly related to his education and early biography), I will first show the influence of the Portuguese-Brazilian historian Joao Lucio de Azevedo on Freyre's views on Jews, conversos and Judaism. On the other hand, I will argue that Freyre's reification of 'the Jew' paradoxically comes from his way of depicting Brazil's identity as an inclusive combination between different 'races', cultures and 'characters'. A comparison with Americo Castro's narratives of Spain, as stemming from an interaction between Christians, Muslims and Jews, will show that Freyre's anti-Jewish prejudices paradoxically emerged from his 'mestizo' views.","[Stuczynski, Claude B.] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Stuczynski, CB (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",,,,,,,,76,0,0,0,1,MODERN HUMANITIES RESEARCH ASSOCIATION,LONDON,"1 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AF, ENGLAND",0267-5315,2222-4270,,PORTUGUESE STUD,Portuguese Stud.,,2019,35,1,,,,,55,+,,,,,,23,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,IB3VJ,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000470195300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite research supporting the use of lifestyle modification in addition to weight loss medications and surgery, when necessary, there is decreased utilization in persons with lower so-cioeconomic status or who are ethnic minorities.

A history of unconsented medical and research experimentation on vulnerable groups and residual healthcare provider biases toward minoritized patients has led to patient distrust of medical systems and poor quality of care. Historical discriminatory housing and lending policies resulted in racial residential segregation and neighborhoods with inadequate housing, healthy food access, and educational resources, resulting in present-day social determinants of health (SDOH). To reduce these disparities and achieve health equity, four disruptive healthcare innovations are recommended: (i) infuse health equity principles into clinical workflows by implementing National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Standards; (ii) address poverty-related SDOH; (iii) deliver care and recruit for research in nonclinical settings to reach marginalized communities; and (iv) leverage health system subject matter experts to advocate for health equity policies. During the COVID-19 pandemic we leveraged the diversity of our workforce to deliver bilingual and culturally tailored COVID-19 testing, education, and vaccines to the Hispanic and Black communities in nonclinical settings, the primary marginalized communities served by our health system that were also disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Now that we understand the importance of using innovative health equity strategies to reach marginalized communities, we must continue to re-engineer our healthcare systems to deliver care outside of our brick and mortar to overcome barriers in access to care and mistrust in the healthcare establishment stemming from past abuses and remaining experiences of bias.","[Golden, Sherita Hill] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Golden, Sherita Hill] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Golden, Sherita Hill] Johns Hopkins Med, Off Divers Inclus & Hlth Equ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Golden, SH (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Golden, SH (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Golden, SH (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Med, Off Divers Inclus & Hlth Equ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",sahill@jhmi.edu,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0009-9236,1532-6535,,CLIN PHARMACOL THER,Clin.

J,"Werbner, P",,,,"Werbner, P",,,The translocation of culture: 'community cohesion' and the force of multiculturalism in history,SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IDENTITY,"In his work on a Welsh border village, Ronald Frankenberg showed how cultural performances, from football to carnival, conferred agency on local actors and framed local conflicts. The present article extends these themes. It responds to invocations of 'community cohesion' by politicians and policy makers, decrying the failure of communal leadership following riots by young South Asians in northern British towns. Against their critique of self-segregating isolationism, the article traces the historical process of Pakistani migration and settlement in Britain, to argue that the dislocations and relocations of transnational migration generate two paradoxes of culture. The first is that in order to sink roots in a new country, transnational migrants in the modern world begin by setting themselves culturally and socially apart. They form encapsulated 'communities'. Second, that within such communities culture can be conceived of as conflictual, open, hybridising and fluid, while nevertheless having a sentimental and morally compelling force. This stems from the fact, I propose, that culture is embodied in ritual, in social exchange and in performance, conferring agency and empowering different social actors: religious and secular, men, women and youth. Hence, against both defenders and critics of multiculturalism as a political and philosophical theory of social justice, the final part of the article argues for the need to theorise multiculturalism in history. In this view, rather than being fixed by liberal or socialist universal philosophical principles, multicultural citizenship must be grasped as changing and dialogical, inventive and responsive, a negotiated political order. The British Muslim diasporic struggle for recognition in the context of local racism and world international crises exemplifies this process.","Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England",Keele University,"Keele Univ, Keele, Staffs, England.",,,,,,,,72,62,79,2,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0038-0261,1467-954X,,SOCIOL REV,Sociol.

Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.","[Chaudhary, V.

This paper reviews current scholarship and highlights three areas where disability studies and development geography share under-explored empirical connections and theoretical resonances: the disability-poverty nexus, interventions in the name of improvement and cure, and mobility and migration. Yet bringing greater attention to disability in development must be done carefully, given the fraught nature of the disability category.

Research on WOC in engineering is usually drawn from all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which does little to illuminate the nuanced experiences of WOC within engineering culture. We sought a primary emphasis on persistence and perseverance rather than the typical examinations on mentoring, inventions, work-life balance, or the challenges that WOC face in engineering faculty environments. There are few studies on how and why women of color persist in academia in the face of the intersection of racism and sexism. Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework and inductive qualitative analyses of interviews with 56 women of color who identified as Asian, Black, Latina, and/or multiracial, we analyzed the sources of support for their persistence. Asking which collective factors support WOC in general and which are unique to each of the racial/ gender groups, we identified three major themes-persistence is aided by (1) supportive colleagues internal to the department or institution, (2) supportive colleagues external to the institution, and (3) the intersectional considerations of group-specific nuances shared by Black, Latina, and Asian women engineering faculty members. The implications suggest women of color thrive in departments with supportive faculty, proactive leadership, and a commitment to professional development.

Persons excluded because of their ethnicity or race (PEERs) experience lower course performance, major retention, sense of belonging, and degree completion. It is unclear though how pervasive these issues are across an institution, from the individual instructor, course, and discipline perspectives. Examining over six years of institutional data from a large-enrollment, research-intensive, minority-serving university, we present an analysis of racial opportunity gaps between PEERs and non-PEERs to identify the consistency of these issues. From this analysis, we find that there is considerable variability as to whether a given course section taught by a single instructor does or does not exhibit opportunity gaps, although encouragingly we did identify exemplar instructors, course-instructor pairs, courses, and departments that consistently had no significant gaps observed. We also identified significant variation across course-instructor pairs within a department, and found that certain STEM disciplines were much more likely to have courses that exhibited opportunity gaps relative to others. Across nearly all disciplines though, it is clear that these gaps are more pervasive in the lower division curriculum. This work highlights a means to identify the extent of inequity in STEM success across a university by leveraging institutional data. These findings also lay the groundwork for future studies that will enable the intentional design of STEM education reform by leveraging beneficial practices used by instructors and departments assigning equitable grades.","[Denaro, Kameryn; Dennin, Kimberly; Sato, Brian] Univ Calif Irvine, Div Teaching Excellence & Innovat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Dennin, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Div Undergrad Educ, Irvine, CA USA; [Dennin, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA USA; [Sato, Brian] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Denaro, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Div Teaching Excellence & Innovat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kdenaro@uci.edu,"Denaro, Kameryn/AAD-7801-2019","Denaro, Kameryn/0000-0001-9175-1640; Dennin, Kimberly/0000-0002-5081-0824",National Science Foundation [NSF DUE 1821724],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank the individuals involved in facilitating the acquisition of the data utilized in our analyses.

In South Africa, where cancer detection, intervention, and care are available for many citizens, cancer is poorly detected and understood among politically and economically marginalized communities in rural and urban centers. These trends are reflected in a history of systematic marginalization of such contexts from public resources, including education and health care, stemming from racism and wealth inequity. This article investigates how Black South Africans residing in Soweto, a township of Johannesburg, perceive and experience breast and prostate cancers amidst multiple, concurrent medical conditions. We used convenience sampling to recruit 80 study participants already enrolled in longitudinal studies of breast and prostate cancers at a tertiary hospital in Soweto between June and August 2017. This included 50 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 30 men diagnosed with prostate cancer; three-quarters of the sample had two or more comorbidities, including HIV, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, and others. Many described sickness in terms of any physical ill-health that affected daily routines, but rarely was it associated exclusively with a specific disease. Men and women described more fear associated with cancer than HIV or hypertension-two of the most common diseases. We found that this may be in part a reflection of how people feared and demonized their cancer diagnoses, calling it a demon!, and framing cancer through the trauma of aggressive treatments like chemotherapy (the red devil!) and physical disfiguration from mastectomy. In contrast, men's prostate cancer treatments were often hormonal therapy and men associated cancer to a normal side effect of aging. Intervening in how people think about cancer may improve how people live well with the condition amidst other cascading social and health problems they face.","[Mendenhall, Emily] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Sci Technol & Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Mendenhall, Emily; Bosire, Edna N.; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung; Norris, Shane A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, SAMRC Dev Pathways Hlth Res Unit, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Kim, Andrew Wooyoung] Northwestern Univ, Dept Anthropol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Norris, Shane A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Noncommunicable Dis Res Div, Wits Hlth Consortium Pty Ltd, Johannesburg, South Africa",Georgetown University; University of Witwatersrand; Northwestern University; University of Witwatersrand,"Mendenhall, E (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Sci Technol & Int Affairs, 513 Intercultural Ctr,37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",em1061@georgetown.edu,"Norris, Shane/C-4664-2014; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung/E-5247-2019; Bosire, Edna N/AAV-3246-2021; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung/JCD-9167-2023","Norris, Shane/0000-0001-7124-3788; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung/0000-0002-0148-7565; Bosire, Edna N/0000-0002-4781-7101; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung/0000-0002-0148-7565; Mendenhall, Emily/0000-0002-5826-1321","School of Foreign Service Summer Academic Grant and Provost's Pilot Research Project Grant at Georgetown University; South African Medical Research Council; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; NIH [NCI 1R01CA192627]; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa","School of Foreign Service Summer Academic Grant and Provost's Pilot Research Project Grant at Georgetown University; South African Medical Research Council(South African Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)South Africa Medical Research Council (SAMRC)); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa","This research was funded by grants awarded to EM from the School of Foreign Service Summer Academic Grant and Provost's Pilot Research Project Grant at Georgetown University.

It provides broader implications for other ethnic minorities. Design/methodology/approach A content analysis of black male advertising images culled from over 60 years of issues of two male-targeted magazines assesses these changes. The analysis contextualizes the imagery in African-American history and general media portrayals periodized into seven historical phases. Findings Results indicate that the number of black male advertising representations has exploded in the past 30 years from virtual invisibility to over 20 per cent of all male ad images. Roles have migrated from representations of black ad models as servants and porters to a wide range of images of black men in professional contexts. However, black males, relative to white males, are disproportionately presented in ads as athletic figures and celebrities and rarely depicted in romantic situations. Research limitations/implications This research focuses on two popular male-targeted publications, thereby limiting its scope. Relatively few black male images (relative to white male images) are to be found in print advertisements in these publications. Practical implications This research assists business practitioners as they create business and marketing strategies to meet the needs of an ever more diverse marketplace. Social implications The disproportionately large number of black male depictions as athletes and sports celebrities is indicative of remnant racism and minority stereotyping in American society. Originality/value This research builds upon work done by Kassarjian (1969, 1971) on black advertising images. Its originality stems from a specific focus on male models as viewed by male consumers, the addition of historic context and periodization to this history and the updating of past research by almost half a century.","[Branchik, Blaine J.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Dept Mkt, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Davis, Judy Foster] Eastern Michigan Univ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Nova Southeastern University; Eastern Michigan University,"Davis, JF (corresponding author), Eastern Michigan Univ, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",judy.davis@emich.edu,,,,,,,102,4,4,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1755-750X,1755-7518,,J HIST RES MARKETING,J.

We aimed to investigate AL among Black men with equivalent education status after controlling for income. A cross-sectional study was employed to investigate AL among 4113 Black men who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999-2018. A summation of 8 biomarker factors were used to compute AL, differences in socio-demographic characteristics by education status were evaluated, and health behaviors that may influence AL were examined. To determine the high-risk thresholds for each AL component, we examined each component's distribution among NHB men for whom complete biomarker data were available in the NHANES sample. High-risk thresholds were determined as either (1) above the 75th percentile for body mass index (BMI), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol, and serum triglycerides; or (2) below the 25th percentile for serum albumin and serum creatinine. Modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals for high AL risk while adjusting for potential confounders. Black men with a high school diploma/GED had a greater prevalence of high AL compared with Black men who had other levels of education, and a slightly higher prevalence of high AL compared with Black men who had less than a high school education. Black men with college degrees had a lower prevalence of high AL than Black men with the lowest levels of educational attainment. Researchers must further examine the hidden costs stemming from the interplay between discrimination associated with being Black in America and systemic racism in the educational system-which may be preventing Black men from achieving optimal health.","[Rogers, Charles R.; Petersen, Ethan; Brooks, Ellen; Kennedy, Carson] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA; [Moore, Justin X.] Augusta Univ, Med Coll Georgia, Georgia Canc Ctr, Canc Prevent Control & Populat Hlth,Dept Med, Augusta, GA 30912 USA; [Gilmore, Danielle R.] George Washington Univ, Trachtenberg Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Gilmore, Danielle R.; Thorpe, Roland J., Jr.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Hopkins Ctr Hlth Dispar Solut, Program Res Mens Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University System of Georgia; Augusta University; George Washington University; Johns Hopkins University,"Rogers, CR (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Salt Lake City, UT 84108 USA.",charles.rogers@utah.edu; jusmoore@augusta.edu; danielleg@email.gwu.edu; ethan.petersen@hsc.utah.edu; ellen.brooks@utah.edu; u1068835@utah.edu; rthorpe@jhu.edu,,"Rogers, Dr. Charles R/0000-0002-3571-8229; Gilmore, Danielle/0000-0003-1090-3804; Moore, Justin Xavier/0000-0002-5496-752X","5 For The Fight; V Foundation for Cancer Research; National Cancer Institute (NCI) [K01CA234319]; National Institute on Aging (NIA) [K02AG059140]; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) [K01MD015304, U54MD000214]; Huntsman Cancer Institute",5 For The Fight; V Foundation for Cancer Research; National Cancer Institute (NCI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Institute on Aging (NIA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD)); Huntsman Cancer Institute,"This research was supported by 5 For The Fight, Huntsman Cancer Institute, and the V Foundation for Cancer Research; by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) under Grant K01CA234319; by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) under Grant K02AG059140; and by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) under Grants K01MD015304 and U54MD000214.

Results of this qualitative study suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed Black women to critically examine their identities as both Black women and health care professionals. Further, Black women nursing professionals intensified their patient education and advocacy efforts to try to reduce severe illness and deaths among Black Americans. Introduction: The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) explore how Black women perceive their roles as nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) how Black women in nursing mobilized themselves to respond to the disproportionate numbers of Black Americans impacted by COVID-19. Method: I conducted semistructured interviews with 6 Black women nursing professionals (5 nurse practitioners and 1 registered nurse). Data were analyzed in 3 cycles: eclectic coding, focused coding, and identifying subthemes and major themes in the data. Results: I identified 1 major theme, educating as motherwork, from the data with the following subthemes: educating our own and balancing education with advocacy. Discussion: Participants provided education to Black patients about controlling underlying health conditions and making lifestyle changes to reduce the impact of COVID-19. They advocated for changes in health care that reflect the needs and sociohistorical experiences of Black Americans to improve the overall quality of health care. This type of Black women's motherwork or reproductive labor reflects a sense of Black consciousness stemming from their identity as Black women and their recognition of the importance of women in Black families and communities. Participants educated and advocated for Black patients while negotiating their own experiences with systemic racism in health care as Black women nursing professionals.","[Edwards, Adrienne L.] Winthrop Univ, Dept Counseling Leadership & Educ Studies, 232-D Withers Bldg, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA",,"Edwards, AL (corresponding author), Winthrop Univ, Dept Counseling Leadership & Educ Studies, 232-D Withers Bldg, Rock Hill, SC 29733 USA.",edwardsal@winthrop.edu,,"Edwards-Bianchi, Adrienne/0000-0002-8273-2138",,,,,37,2,2,0,2,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1091-7527,1939-0602,,FAM SYST HEALTH,Fam.

Physics courses often have high failure rates that disproportionately harm students who are historically and continually marginalized by racism, sexism, and classism. We examined the associations between learning assistant (LA) supported courses and equity in nonpassing grades [i.e., drop, fail, or withdrawal (DFW)] in introductory physics courses. The data used in the study came from 2312 students in 41 sections of introductory physics courses at a regional Hispanic serving institution. We developed hierarchical generalized linear models of student DFW rates that accounted for gender, race, first-generation status, and LA-supported instruction. We used a quantitative critical race theory (QuantCrit) perspective focused on the role of hegemonic power structures in perpetuating inequitable student outcomes. Our QuantCrit perspective informed our research questions, methods, and interpretations of findings. The models associated LAs with overall decreases in DFW rates and larger decreases in DFW rates for Black, Indigenous, and people of color than their White peers. While the inequities in DFW rates were lower in LA-supported courses, they were still present.","[Van Dusen, Ben] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Sci Educ, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Nissen, Jayson] JM Nissen Consulting, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA",California State University System; California State University Chico,"Van Dusen, B (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Sci Educ, Chico, CA 95929 USA.",,"Van Dusen, Ben/CAI-1341-2022","Van Dusen, Ben/0000-0003-1264-0550","NSF-IUSE [DUE-1525338, 1928596]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development [1928596] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF-IUSE; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This work was funded in part by NSF-IUSE Grants No. DUE-1525338 and No. 1928596 and is contribution No. LAA-065 of the Learning Assistant Alliance.

This paper specifically calls on the importance of an intersectional analysis of ability and the need for explicit conversation on the interwoven nature of race and disability to uncover exclusionary practices of hyper-labeling, hyper-surveilling, and hyper-punishing for those outside notions of normalcy. Drawing on sociopolitical perspectives informed by Disability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) and DisCrit Classroom Ecology, I share a framework of DisCrit noticing to consider the interwoven nature of racism and ableism in mathematics classrooms, provide a context to develop preservice teacher DisCrit noticing during mathematics methods, and a case example to highlight implications and transformative possibilities for (re)organizing classrooms through the DisCrit noticing framework.","[Yeh, Cathery] Univ Texas Austin, Coll Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, STEM Educ Program, Austin, TX USA; [Yeh, Cathery] Coll Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Sanchez Bldg,1912 Speedway Stop 4-404, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Yeh, CTY (corresponding author), Coll Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Sanchez Bldg,1912 Speedway Stop 4-404, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",cathery.yeh@austin.utexas.edu,,"Yeh, Cathery/0000-0002-4006-969X",,,,,93,1,1,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-6803,1949-8594,,SCHOOL SCI MATH,Sch.

We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization. We predict that the EmotoTent socio-emotional learning program will improve school cultures and create a foundation for children's lifelong well-being.","[Antle, Alissa N.; Sadka, Ofir; Gong, Boxiao; Cheung, Victor; Baishya, Uddipana] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Interact Arts & Technol, Surrey, BC, Canada; [Radu, Iulian] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Simon Fraser University; Harvard University,"Antle, AN (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Interact Arts & Technol, Surrey, BC, Canada.",aantle@sfu.ca; osadka@sfu.ca; iulian_radu@gse.harvard.edu; boxiaog@sfu.ca; vca45@sfu.ca; ubaishya@sfu.ca,,,,,,,28,8,8,4,15,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6690-8,,,,2019,,,,,,,755,760,,10.1145/3311927.3326596,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3311927.3326596,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BP6EZ,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000559055100103,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, we examine how the seemingly positive ideal to make technology useful i.e. to build systems and devices that advance social and technological progress - masks various forms of violence and injustice such as colonial othering, racist exclusions, and exploitation. Drawing from ethnographic research, we show how design and computing methods from design thinking to agile theory and entrepreneurial approaches in tech production and higher education are the latest techniques in the cultivation of useful bodies on behalf of the state, the corporation, the university, and the economy. Aligning with feminist, critical race and critical computing commitments, this paper offers a genealogical approach to show how injustice and violence endure, despite and because of a narrative of progress and positive change.","[Lin, Cindy; Lindtner, Silvia Margot] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Lin, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cindylky@umich.edu; lindtner@umich.edu,,"Lin, Cindy/0000-0002-9273-4970","National Science Foundation [1617898, 1513596, 1744359, 1900722]; Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan; Dow Sustainability Fellows Program; Rackham International Research Award at the University of Michigan; Humanities Collaboratory Award at the University of Michigan; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1513596] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1900722] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1744359] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Undergraduate Education [1744359] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems [1513596] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1617898] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan; Dow Sustainability Fellows Program; Rackham International Research Award at the University of Michigan; Humanities Collaboratory Award at the University of Michigan(University of Michigan System); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Division Of Undergraduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"We thank all of our participants, the anonymous reviewers who have greatly helped us improve this paper as well as Nazanin Andalibi, Sarita Schoenebeck, Sylvia Simioni for their helpful comments on an early draft.

For others, it reiterated the persistent social injustice in the United States. Compelled by these events, 30 diverse individuals came together from January to May 2021 for a semester-long seminar exploring inequity in archaeological practice. The seminar's discussions spotlighted the inequity and social injustices that are deeply embedded within the discipline. However, inequity in archaeology is often ignored or treated narrowly as discrete, if loosely bound, problems. A broad approach to inequity in archaeology revealed injustice to be intersectional, with compounding effects. Through the overarching themes of individual, community, theory, and practice, we (a subset of the seminar's participants) explore inequity and its role in various facets of archaeology, including North-South relations, publication, resource distribution, class differences, accessibility, inclusive theories, service to nonarchaeological communities, fieldwork, mentorship, and more. We focus on creating a roadmap for understanding the intersectionality of issues of inequity and suggesting avenues for continued education and direct engagement. We argue that community-building-by providing mutual support and building alliances-provides a pathway for realizing greater equity in our discipline.","[Prince, Jordi A.

Research demonstrates that adults tend to exhibit a bias toward believing a child is telling the truth, but it is unknown whether this truth bias applies equally to all children. Given the pervasiveness of racial prejudice and anti-Black racism in the United States, the current study examined whether adults are more or less likely to believe a child is telling the truth based on the race of the child (Black or White), the race of the adult perceiver (Black or White), and the perceiver's concerns regarding appearing unprejudiced. MethodsUsing an online data-collection platform, 593 Black and White American adults reviewed fictitious vignettes in which a child denied committing a misbehavior at school (e.g., damaging a laptop). The race of the child in the vignette was manipulated using an AI-generated photo of either a Black child or a White child. After reading each story, participants provided a categorical veracity judgment by indicating whether they believed the child in the story was lying (and therefore committed the misdeed) or telling the truth (and was innocent), as well as rated how honest or deceptive the child was being on a continuous scale. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing their internal (personal) and external (normative) motivations to respond in non-prejudiced ways. Results and discussionResults indicated that systematic racial biases occur in adults' veracity judgments of children's statements. Both Black and White participants exhibited a truth bias in their veracity judgments of Black children, but not when evaluating the deceptiveness of White children. Consistent with the prejudice-related concerns hypothesis, the observed truth bias toward Black children was moderated by individual differences in participants' desire to respond without prejudice and whether those motivations stem from external or internal sources. The current findings present novel evidence regarding racial bias and prejudice-related concerns as potential barriers to making veracity judgments of children's statements and, ultimately, successful lie detection.","[Zanette, Sarah] Univ Regina, Luther Coll, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada; [Zanette, Sarah; Hussein, Siham Hagi] Univ Regina, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada; [Malloy, Lindsay C.] Ontario Tech Univ, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Oshawa, ON, Canada",University of Regina; University of Regina,"Zanette, S (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Luther Coll, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada.;Zanette, S (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada.",sarah.zanette@uregina.ca,,"Zanette, Sarah/0000-0001-6215-293X; Hagi Hussein, Siham/0000-0001-8329-7919",American Psychology Law Society Grants in Aid for Early Career Professionals; Luther College President's Research Fund,American Psychology Law Society Grants in Aid for Early Career Professionals; Luther College President's Research Fund,"This research was supported through research grants awarded to the first author by the (1) American Psychology Law Society Grants in Aid for Early Career Professionals, and the (2) Luther College President's Research Fund.",,70,0,0,1,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

J,"Martel, J",,,,"Martel, James",,,"The Law of Rules: Hyperlegalism, Emergency and the Violence of Procedure",LAW CULTURE AND THE HUMANITIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nasser Hussain; Keally McBride; violence; procedure; emergency; rule of law; codification,,"This article draws on the work of Nasser Hussain and Keally McBride to think about the way that law is violent. Hussain's work shows that the law's much vaunted distinction between ordinary law and the state of emergency is a false dichotomy, one that stems from Britain's colonial legacy wherein only Britain was said to follow the rule of law and other parts of the world (including areas that it therefore got to colonize) were subject to a perpetual state of emergency. Hussain shows how this binary serves to make British rule seem benign and palatable even as it disguises the way that the British state was violent, not only in the colonies but also in the metropole. By looking further at the practices of ordinary law, I argue via Hussain and McBride that procedure and codification, nominally the benign and nonviolent practice of creating order and method in the practice of non-emergency law, are themselves thoroughly violent. Hussain shows this through his notion of hyperlegalism whereby places (such as Guantanamo) are said to be lawless but are actually suffused with various forms of ordinary law. McBride shows this through her study of the life work of James Stephen and James Fitzjames Stephen, a father and son who administered much of the legal practices of the British Empire in the mid 19th century and who were both essentially the embodiment of the rule of law in the colonies. In both cases, more for the father than for the son, any attempt to render the rule of law nonviolent met with failure. Codification became the way to formalize and disguise the degree to which the law perpetuates (rather than holds back) the violence and racism of empire. In this way procedure and codification are not just the means for state violence but are themselves a form of violence, a kind of law of rules, conforming to what Walter Benjamin calls law preserving violence.","[Martel, James] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Francisco, CA 94703 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Martel, J (corresponding author), San Francisco State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Francisco, CA 94703 USA.",jmartel@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1743-8721,1743-9752,,LAW CULT HUMANIT,Law Cult.

This prompted many institutions of higher education, including professional organizations and societies, to engage in long-overdue conversations about the role of scientific institutions in perpetuating racism. Similar to many professional societies and organizations, the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER), a leading international professional organization for discipline-based biology education researchers, has long struggled with a lack of representation of People of Color (POC) at all levels within the organization. The events surrounding Mr. Floyd's death prompted the members of SABER to engage in conversations to promote self-reflection and discussion on how the society could become more antiracist and inclusive. These, in turn, resulted in several initiatives that led to concrete actions to support POC, increase their representation, and amplify their voices within SABER. These initiatives included: a self-study of SABER to determine challenges and identify ways to address them, a year-long seminar series focused on issues of social justice and inclusion, a special interest group to provide networking opportunities for POC and to center their voices, and an increase in the diversity of keynote speakers and seminar topics at SABER conferences. In this article, we chronicle the journey of SABER in its efforts to become more inclusive and antiracist. We are interested in increasing POC representation within our community and seek to bring our resources and scholarship to reimagine professional societies as catalyst agents towards an equitable antiracist experience. Specifically, we describe the 12 concrete actions that SABER enacted over a period of a year and the results from these actions so far. In addition, we discuss remaining challenges and future steps to continue to build a more welcoming, inclusive, and equitable space for all biology education researchers, especially our POC members. Ultimately, we hope that the steps undertaken by SABER will enable many more professional societies to embark on their reflection journeys to further broaden scientific communities.","[Segura-Totten, Miriam] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, Dahlonega, GA USA; [Dewsbury, Bryan] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Lo, Stanley M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biol Sci & Program Math & Sci Educ, Sect Cell & Dev Biol, La Jolla, CA USA; [Bailey, Elizabeth Gibbons] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Beaster-Jones, Laura; Garcia-Ojeda, Marcos E.] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Merced, CA USA; [Bills, Robert J.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY USA; [Brownell, Sara E.; Nadile, Erika M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Caporale, Natalia] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behavior, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Dunk, Ryan] Univ Northern Colorado, Greeley, CO USA; [Eddy, Sarah L.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL USA; [Gardner, Stephanie M.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN USA; [Green, Linda E.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Hartley, Laurel] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Integrat Biol, Denver, CO USA; [Harrison, Colin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Imad, Mays] Pima Community Coll, Tucson, AZ USA; [Janosik, Alexis M.] Univ West Florida, Dept Biol, Pensacola, FL USA; [Jeong, Sophia] Ohio State Univ, Coll Educ Human Ecol, Dept Teaching & Learning, Columbus, OH USA; [Josek, Tanya] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL USA; [Kadandale, Pavan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA USA; [Knight, Jenny; Sabel, Jaime L.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO USA; [Ko, Melissa E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kukday, Sayali] Iowa State Univ, Dept Genet Dev & Cell Biol, Ames, IA USA; [Lemons, Paula] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA USA; [Litster, Megan] Univ Wisconsin La Crosse, Dept Biol, La Crosse, WI USA; [Lom, Barbara] Davidson Coll, Biol & Neurosci, Davidson, NC USA; [Ludwig, Patrice] James Madison Univ, Dept Biol, Harrisonburg, VA USA; [McDonald, Kelly K.] Calif State Univ, Dept Biological Sci, Sacramento, CA USA; [McIntosh, Anne C.

This disparity is partially due to the unequal burden of unmet social needs that stem from several factors, including racism.Intervention Approach The Alliance is a collaboration among health care, public health, and community organizations formed to improve referral, enrollment, and successful completion of evidence-based lifestyle change programs, particularly among Black people. The Alliance built 1) a system to assess and address social barriers through the screening and referral process and 2) a training center for frontline staff (eg, community health workers). Evaluation Methods From January 2020 through September 2022, we conducted an evaluation that included both quantitative and qualitative methods. We developed an electronic database to make referrals and track key barriers to participation. Additionally, we conducted a focus group among frontline staff (N = 15) to understand the challenges in making referrals and discussing, documenting, and addressing barriers to participation. We used surveys that collected quantitative and open-ended qualitative responses to evaluate the training center and to understand perceptions of training modules as well as the skills gained.Results Frontline staff engaged with 6,036 people, of whom 847 (14%) were referred to a lifestyle-change program from January 2020 through September 2022. Of those referred, 257 (30%) were eligible and enrolled in a program. Food access and unreliable inter net were the most common barriers to participation. Thirteen of 15 frontline staff participated in trainings, and, on average, trainees completed 4.2 trainings and gained several skills (eg, ability to monitor personal bias, de-escalate a crisis, educate on mental health, understand community and environmental factors). Implications for Public Health The Alliance is an example of how health care, public health, and community partners can work together to increase enrollment in lifestyle-change programs of residents disproportionately affected by chronic diseases. Lessons learned from implementation and evaluation can inform other complex partnerships to improve public health.","[Kepper, Maura; Mudd, Natalie; Deitch, Ariel; Liu, Julia; Eyler, Amy] Washington Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, 1 Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1196, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Stamatakis, Katherine A.; Terhaar, Ally] Washington Univ, Coll Publ Hlth & Social Justice, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gates, Emerald] St Louis Cty Dept Publ Hlth, St Louis, MO USA; [Williams, Bobie] City St Louis Dept Hlth, St Louis, MO USA; [Cole, Gabrielle] Fit & Food Connect, St Louis, MO USA; [French, Carolyn S.] Gateway Reg YMCA, St Louis, MO USA; [Hampton, Amy] Bur Canc & Chron Dis Prevent, Missouri Dept Hlth & Sr Serv, Jefferson City, MO USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Kepper, M (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Prevent Res Ctr, 1 Brookings Dr,Campus Box 1196, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",kepperm@wustl.edu,"Wu, Shan-Ying/AED-9841-2022","Wu, Shan-Ying/0000-0003-2380-5760; Terhaar, Ally/0009-0006-0669-9184",Prevention Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis [U48DP006395]; CDC [HE2021-0202],Prevention Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis; CDC(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA),"& nbsp;This work was supported by the Prevention Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis (no.

We used a case study design focusing on a group of 10 preservice teachers' participation in educational programming that focused on environmental racism and connected science to larger social issues in an economically dispossessed Mexican community in Chicago. Using theoretical lenses of humanistic science education, justice-centered science pedagogy, and structure-agency dialectic, we studied how preservice high school science teachers made sense of equity and social justice issues facing marginalized communities and how they thought about the goals and nature of science education, along with their role as science teachers, as they participated in a Toxic Tour provided by the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. By emphasizing both environmental challenges and the community assets in Little Village, the Toxic Tour provided an opportunity for science teacher candidates to develop a complex understanding of this particular community and critically reflect on their own communities. The teacher candidates identified both structures that are enabling or disabling for community members and people's individual and collective agency acting upon these structures. They also recognized communities as places of authentic science learning.","[Varelas, Maria; Morales-Doyle, Daniel; Raza, Syeda; Segura, David; Canales, Karen; Mitchener, Carole] Univ Illinois, Coll Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Varelas, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",mvarelas@uic.edu,,"Morales-Doyle, Daniel/0000-0002-9425-2158",National Science Foundation [DUE-1439761]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1439761] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"The research reported in this paper has been supported by the National Science Foundation grant DUE-1439761.

Trump's comments constituted a departure from the egalitarian norms that had long characterized American political discourse. Here, we examine the potential effects of Trump's rhetoric on Americans' attitudes, predicting that these high-profile norm violations may have reshaped the personal prejudices of the American people. In 13 studies including over 10,000 participants, we tested how Americans' prejudice changed following the political ascension of Donald Trump. We found that explicit racial and religious prejudice significantly increased amongst Trump's supporters, whereas individuals opposed to Trump exhibited decreases in prejudice. Further, changing social norms appear to explain these changes in prejudice. These results suggest that Trump's presidency coincided with a substantial change in the topography of prejudice in the United States. Ruisch and Ferguson examine changes in prejudice in the United States during Trump's presidency. They find both increases in prejudice amongst Trump's supporters and decreases amongst those opposed to Trump, changes that seem to stem from perceived social norms.","[Ruisch, Benjamin C.] Univ Kent, Sch Psychol, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Ferguson, Melissa J.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT USA",University of Kent; Yale University,"Ruisch, BC (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Psychol, Canterbury, Kent, England.",b.ruisch@kent.ac.uk,,"Ruisch, Benjamin/0000-0002-4087-1834",NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [1144153]; European Commission Marie Skodowska-Curie Fellowship [897440]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [897440] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA); Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1144153] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Commission Marie Skodowska-Curie Fellowship(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions); Division Of Graduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This research was supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (grant no. 1144153) and European Commission Marie Skodowska-Curie Fellowship (grant no. 897440) to B.C.R.

Due to low representation of FOC at higher ranks in many fields, FOC are often mentored by someone of a different race, typically someone who is white. Faculty mentors who differ from their mentee on race may be less equipped to support FOC in navigating the unique challenges they face within the academy (e.g., racism, tokenism, microaggressions), but may also use their racial privilege to support mentees. The current qualitative study examines FOC perceptions about how race affects their cross-racial mentoring relationships. We analyzed interview data of 56 tenure-track faculty from a large, predominantly white, Midwestern research university. Our analysis yielded three themes: (a) factors that shape how race affects the mentoring relationship, (b) racial difference as conferring benefits to the mentoring relationship, and (c) racial difference as irrelevant to the mentoring relationship. In our discussion, we highlight the ways cross-racial mentors can offer support to FOC, while also taking into account the limitations associated with these mentoring relationships. We conclude with recommendations for how institutions may enhance the mentoring of FOC.","[Thorne, Kelsie M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol & Sch Social Work, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Jones, Martinque K.] Univ North Texas, Dept Psychol, Denton, TX USA; [Davis, Tangier M.; Settles, Isis H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Settles, Isis H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Afroamerican & African Studies, Ann Arbor, MI USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Settles, IH (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",isettles@umich.edu,,"Settles, Isis/0000-0001-5015-7231; Thorne, Kelsie/0000-0003-3481-5147; Davis, Tangier/0000-0002-6870-4835",ADAPPADVANCE office (National Science Foundation) at Michigan State University [0811205]; Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources [0811205] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,ADAPPADVANCE office (National Science Foundation) at Michigan State University; Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University; Division Of Human Resource Development; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This research received funding from the ADAPPADVANCE office (National Science Foundation, Grant 0811205) at Michigan State University and from the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University.

In this article, we establish an intercultural approach to computing education, informed by intercultural and peace education, prejudice reduction, and the sociology of racism and ethnicity. We outline three major concerns of intercultural computing: shifting from content toward relationships, from cultural responsiveness to cultural reflexivity, and from identity to identification. For the last, we complicate discourses of race and identity widespread in U.S. education. Drawing from studies of youth programming classes in East Africa and U.S. contexts, we then reflect on our attempts to address the first shift of fostering relationships across difference. We highlight three promising design tactics: intergroup pairing, interdependent programming, and making relational goals explicit. Overall, we find that computing can indeed be a site of intergroup bonding across difference, but that bonding can carry complications and tensions with other equity goals and tactics. Rather than framing justice-oriented CS primarily as changes to the aims of computational learning, we argue that future work should explore making relational goals explicit and teach students how to attend to friction.","[Arawjo, Ian] Cornell Univ, Bill & Melinda Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Mogos, Ariam] Stanford Univ, Dsch, 416 Escondido Mall 550, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Cornell University; Stanford University,"Arawjo, I (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Bill & Melinda Gates Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",iaa32@cornell.edu; ariam@nairobiplay.org,,,,,,,148,5,5,0,9,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1946-6226,,,ACM T COMPUT EDUC,ACM Trans.

Often, diversity and inclusion issues, along with other societal challenges, are perceived as unrelated to engineering. Conversely, engineering as currently practiced and taught is embedded in dominant culture norms that are frequently invisible to the majority of the students and faculty. One strategy to shift this erroneous neutral perspective is to integrate diversity and inclusion into engineering curricula. Using inclusive professional identities as a theoretical lens, we developed an activity that incorporates diversity and inclusion into the technical content of Engineering Mechanics: Statics. Using thematic analysis, we found that students' responses to prompts about their identities, engineering as a profession, and their perceived learning revealed two primary themes: teamwork and engineering/math-related skills/experiences. Although diversity and inclusion were included in responses, students did not connect diversity and inclusion to engineering as a profession. Therefore, students might need more support to make this connection.

Background: Ethnic minority students remain underrepresented in engineering degrees and have higher dropout rates than their White peers. Previous literature pointed out discrimination as a possible cause of these disparities. However, little is known about the factors that trigger these discriminations and to which extent discrimination can predict students' dropout. Knowing this information will help institutions and governments establish support plans for underrepresented students to increase their participation in engineering degrees. Research Questions: 1) Do native-born (NB) and FB students enrolled in engineering degrees differ in their levels of academic satisfaction, self-esteem, perceived discrimination, and dropout intentions? 2) What factors predict the likelihood that FB students would drop out of engineering degrees? 3) What main factors make FB students feel discriminated against on engineering campuses? Methodology: A sample of 602 undergraduate engineering students answered a questionnaire, and descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Findings: FB students reported significantly lower self-esteem than NB students. Contrary to what was expected, FB students did not report significantly higher dropout intentions and perceived discrimination than NB students; possible reasons are discussed. Academic satisfaction, self-esteem, and perceived discrimination were significant predictors of FB students' dropout intentions, with perceived discrimination being the strongest predictor in students most at risk of dropping out. Finally, the study identifies the most relevant reasons, situations, and people causing discrimination on engineering campuses.","[Balta-Salvador, Roso; Olmedo-Torre, Noelia] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Graph & Design Engn, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Pena, Marta] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Math, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Baltà-Salvador, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Graph & Design Engn, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",roso.balta@upc.edu; n.olmedo@upc.edu; marta.penya@upc.edu,"Olmedo-Torre, Noelia/K-8060-2015","Olmedo-Torre, Noelia/0000-0003-2502-3201; Balta-Salvador, Roso/0000-0002-9753-7335",,,,,53,3,3,6,30,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9359,1557-9638,,IEEE T EDUC,IEEE Trans.

Race Matters,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CAMPUS RACIAL CLIMATE; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; PREDOMINANTLY WHITE; CULTURAL-DIVERSITY; PREPARING TEACHERS; HIGH-SCHOOL; STUDENTS; SUCCESS; MICROAGGRESSIONS; STEREOTYPES,"Background/Context: There is a growing body of research that conceptualizes mathematics learning and participation as racialized experiences; that is, learning experiences structured in part by the negative and unjust race relations that are present in U.S. society. However, the role racialized experiences play in the lives of Black elementary education pre-service students from urban contexts, as both students and future teachers of mathematics, is under theorized. Theoretical Framework: Using critical race theory's racial micro-aggressions and the development of a mathematics identity, the author explores the mathematics experiences of 13 Black advanced undergraduate students who are elementary education majors. The participants' narratives reflect their experiences as both students of mathematics and future teachers. Research Design: A qualitative phenomenological research design was used to explore the prior and current mathematical experiences of the study participants and their future trajectories as teachers of mathematics. Reponses were coded to reveal themes of racialization and the development of the participants' mathematics identities. Results: The participants' narratives cited Black male fathers and close male relatives as their first mathematics teachers, the presence of culturally affirming at-home mathematics activities, and detailed aspirations to teach mathematics fearlessly to their own children and future students. Their more recent experiences included academic struggles in mathematics, often stemming from racial stereotyping and non-affirming college mathematics teachers. Their voices suggest that, within the context of learning mathematics, they have generated self-constructions that include racism as part of their shared African American experience in mathematics schooling that have implications for their teaching of mathematics. Conclusion/Recommendations: Recommendations include the provision of professional development that targets gaps in mathematics that are the result of inadequate and discriminatory learning opportunities, and culturally sensitive professional development for mathematics college faculty, with differentiated training for mathematics faculty not born in the U.S. In light of the high proportion of Black teachers working in urban schools who face a host of difficulties, this research also supports the continued development of combatting racial micro-aggressions in mathematics education as a decisive tactic to improve the retention of Black elementary education teachers.","Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Mcgee, EO (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Teaching & Learning, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",,"McGee, Ebony O./F-1747-2016","McGee, Ebony O./0000-0002-0499-2620",,,,,152,17,29,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

Previous studies have examined factors relating to infection amongst HCWs, including those from ethnic minority groups, but there is limited data regarding the lived experiences of HCWs in relation to self-protection and how they deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention. In this study, we presented data from an ethnically diverse sample of HCWs in the United Kingdom (UK) to understand their perceptions of risks and experiences with risk management whilst working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe undertook a qualitative study as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among Healthcare workers (United Kingdom-REACH) conducting semi-structured interviews and focus groups which were recorded with participants' permission. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analyzed. FindingsA total of 84 participants were included in the analysis. Five broad themes emerged. First, ethnic minority HCWs spoke about specific risks and vulnerabilities they faced in relation to their ethnicity. Second, participants' experience of risk assessments at work varied; some expressed satisfaction while many critiqued it as a tick-box exercise. Third, most participants shared about risks related to shortages, ambiguity in guidance, and inequitable distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), particularly during the start of the pandemic. Fourth, participants reported risks resulting from understaffing and inappropriate redeployment. Finally, HCWs shared the risk mitigation strategies which they had personally employed to protect themselves, their families, and the public. ConclusionHealthcare workers identified several areas where they felt at risk and/or had negative experiences of risk management during the pandemic. Our findings indicate that organizational shortcomings may have exposed some HCWs to greater risks of infection compared with others, thereby increasing their emotional and mental burden. Ethnic minority HCWs in particular experienced risks stemming from what they perceived to be institutional and structural racism, thus leading to a loss of trust in employers. These findings have significance in understanding staff safety, wellbeing, and workforce retention in multiethnic staff groups and also highlight the need for more robust, inclusive, and equitable approaches to protect HCWs going forward.","[Qureshi, Irtiza; Chaloner, Jonathan; Hassan, Osama; Nellums, Laura B.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Lifespan & Populat Sci, Nottingham, England; [Gogoi, Mayuri; Wobi, Fatimah; Al-Oraibi, Amani; Pareek, Manish] Univ Leicester, Dept Resp Sci, Leicester, England; [Pan, Daniel; Pareek, Manish] Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Dept Infect & HIV Med, Leicester, England",University of Nottingham; University of Leicester; University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust,"Pareek, M (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Resp Sci, Leicester, England.;Pareek, M (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Dept Infect & HIV Med, Leicester, England.",manish.pareek@leicester.ac.uk,"Bhatt, Deepak L/Y-3070-2019; Pan, Daniel/GYI-8783-2022","Bhatt, Deepak L/0000-0002-1278-6245; Pan, Daniel/0000-0002-1268-2243; Pareek, Manish/0000-0003-1521-9964; Chaloner, Jonathan/0000-0001-9700-8284",MRC-United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) [MR/V027549/1]; Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rapid response panel to tackle COVID-19; NIHR Biomedical Research Centers; NIHR Development and Skills Enhancement Award; NIHR Leicester BRC; NIHR ARC East Midlands; Academy of Medical Sciences [SBF005/1047]; BREATHE-the Health Data Research Hub for Respiratory Health through the United Kingdom Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund [MC_PC_19004],MRC-United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI); Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rapid response panel to tackle COVID-19; NIHR Biomedical Research Centers; NIHR Development and Skills Enhancement Award; NIHR Leicester BRC; NIHR ARC East Midlands; Academy of Medical Sciences(Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)); BREATHE-the Health Data Research Hub for Respiratory Health through the United Kingdom Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund,United Kingdom-REACH was supported by a grant (MR/V027549/1) from the MRC-United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) rapid response panel to tackle COVID-19.

Throughout the years, Virtual Reality (VR) has been adapted for uses beyond equipment and scenario training to encompass data visualization for STEM, historical representations for humanities, and artistic expression and performing arts. Through the past year our project has experimented with the use of VR in a classroom environment to assess cultural communications. In previous years, the Communicating Across Cultures class has tackled topics spanning social justice issues including ableism, sexism, and racism. By leveraging VR and simulation technologies, we have built virtual experiences to better convey the concepts of social justice. The capabilities of VR, allow the user to live a scenario that is choreographed and tailored for a specific goal. In a training simulator, the environment is designed to teach a procedure or task through active participation. However, in our classroom we are attempting to convey a cultural perspective by placing the user in a scenario that may generate understanding. In a TED talk by Chris Milk [1], the concept of using Virtual Reality for generating empathy is explored through a passive film experience. These 360 degree films have the capabilities to immerse a viewer in a world that is different to their own, however provide little in terms of interaction. It is this gap that we explored through the usage of real-time virtual simulation to explore the effects of immersive interaction on empathy. The topic we explored for this first step was ableism, prejudice towards people of differing physical or mental abilities. The VR simulation we created places the user in a biomedical laboratory and is asked to perform a few simple tasks with non-accessible equipment, while constrained to a powered wheelchair. The equipment used includes a Head Mounted Display, joystick for powered navigation, and a hand tracker to enable the user to physically and virtually reach for equipment. In the VR simulation, the user is asked to perform a series of simple tasks in either: a biomedical lab that is not wheelchair accessible or one that contains accessible equipment. Once their task is complete, they switch to the other virtual lab and follow the same tasks.","[Morris, P.; Takahashi, G.; Iseminger, S.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Morris, P (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,25,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,VALENICA,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",2340-1117,,978-84-608-8860-4,EDULEARN PROC,,,2016,,,,,,,2740,2747,,,,,,8,"Education & Educational Research; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Education & Educational Research,BH7TE,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000402955902118,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to learn more about how the changes were communicated, how people responded and any discrepancies between key messages and how they were interpreted by the public. MethodsSummative content analysis of 286 stories and related reader-generated comments in leading UK online news sources (April 2019 to May 2021). Further detailed thematic analysis of 21 articles with reader-generated content, complemented by thematic content analysis coding of all 286 stories. ResultsMost media coverage on both organ donation and the law change was positive, with little variation over time or between publications. The importance of organ donation, benefits of the law change, and emotive stories (often involving children) of those who had donated an organ described as superheroes or those who had received organs as benefiting from a miracle were frequently cited. In contrast, reader-generated comments were markedly more negative, for example, focusing on loss of individual freedom and lack of trust in the organ donation system. Commentators wished to be able to choose who their organs were donated to, were dismissive and blaming towards minority ethnic groups, including undermining legitimate worries about the compatibility of organ donation with religious beliefs and end of life cultural norms, understanding and acceptance of brain-stem death and systemic racism. Misinformation including use of inflammatory language was common. ConclusionThe portrayal of donors and recipients as extraordinary is unlikely to help to normalise organ donation. Undermining legitimate concerns, in particular those from ethnic minorities, can alienate and encourage harmful misinformation in underrepresented groups. The discrepancies between the tone of the articles and the readers comments suggests a lack of trust across the public, health, policy and media outlets. Easily accessible, ongoing and tailored sources are needed to mitigate misinformation and disinformation and ensure key messages are better understood and accepted in order to realise the ambitions of soft opt-out organ donation policies.","[Faherty, Georgia; Williams, Lorraine; Bostock, Jennifer; Mays, Nicholas] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, Policy Innovat & Evaluat Res Unit PIRU, London, England; [Noyes, Jane; Mc Laughlin, Leah] Bangor Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Bangor University,"Mays, N (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, Policy Innovat & Evaluat Res Unit PIRU, London, England.",nicholas.mays@lshtm.ac.uk,"Mc Laughlin, Leah/IQV-5008-2023","Williams, Lorraine/0000-0003-4188-3949",,,,,32,1,1,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-2565,,FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH,Front.

In particular, this project examines the following two research questions: how do children define and understand the concept of cultural diversity; and what do they perceive as the implications of cultural diversity on their daily lives? To this end, interviews were carried out with 40 (immigrant and native) students, aged 11 to 12, at five primary schools in Cyprus, which presented high concentrations of immigrants. On the basis of our analysis of the data, the participant children appeared to perceive cultural diversity in terms of two contrasting perspectives. On the one hand, they viewed cultural diversity in terms of the cultural-deficiency perspective. Such perceptions stemmed from the model of monoculturalism implying the need to assimilate the culturally different' in order to counteract the negative consequences of cultural diversity. On the other hand, the same children also perceived cultural diversity in terms of cultural celebration. To this end, some children drew upon the model of multiculturalism to define cultural diversity as a culture-enriching and culture-celebrating process, pointing to folkloristic activities including traditional music, dance and food. Nonetheless, few of the participant childrenboth Cypriot and immigrantdefined cultural diversity in terms of the model of interculturalism, pointing to the intercultural exchange that stems from real' friendship development between natives and immigrants, equality of rights and inclusion. As the participant children appeared to confuse the meanings and languages of cultural diversity, this paper concludes with suggestions on teacher practices to crystallise' children's views.","[Hajisoteriou, Christina; Karousiou, Christiana; Angelides, Panayiotis] Univ Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Ave,POB 24005, CY-1700 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Nicosia,"Angelides, P (corresponding author), Univ Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Ave,POB 24005, CY-1700 Nicosia, Cyprus.",Angelides.p@unic.ac.cy,"Hajisoteriou, Christina/AAL-1774-2020","Hajisoteriou, Christina/0000-0002-5103-5161",,,,,57,10,12,2,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-1926,1469-3518,,BRIT EDUC RES J,Br.

It makes that case that genetic ancestry kits, and the nutritional recommendations that stem from them, represent a misunderstanding of current genetic science and the capabilities of genetic technologies. I argue that the most troubling outcomes these applications are likely to have is in the further reification and perpetuation of racialized and racializing knowledge and discourses. I also make the case that trends in personalized nutrition are likely to produce yet another locus of inequality based on disparities in access to the 'right' foods, the iniquitous distribution of dietary capital, the further responsibilization of health to individuals, increased surveillance, and a more impoverished and functionalized relationship to food itself.","[Sikka, Tina] Newcastle Univ, Sch Arts & Cultures, Media Culture & Heritage, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Sikka, T (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Arts & Cultures, Media Culture & Heritage, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",tina.sikka@newcastle.ac.uk,,"Sikka, Tina/0000-0003-4728-2896",,,,,88,2,2,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4630,1363-0296,,SOC IDENT,Soc.

However, whereas extant theory assumes that rural resentment stems from rural identification, recently available data shows that beliefs about geographic inequity, which are central to rural resentment, are not held exclusively by those who embrace a rural identity. If geography is not the sole source of rural resentment, then what else explains this ostensibly place-based phenomenon? Among White Americans who do not identify as rural, we posit that belief in the existence of deliberate rural deprivation by government and media elites can be conceived as 'place-based empathy' toward rural Americans. Further, we argue that place empathy toward rural areas is partially an expression of White grievance politics stemming from the belief that the stereotypical rural resident is a White American suffering from relative deprivation at the hands of government officials who privilege non-white (and non-rural) constituents over them. Using the 2020 American National Election Time Series, as well as novel mTurk data, we show that White consciousness predicts beliefs about geographic inequity among non-rural identifiers but not rural identifiers. Instead, consistent with previous research, we show that racial prejudice is a better predictor of geographic attitudes for rural identifiers and White consciousness has little independent association. These findings provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of the ways race and place intersect to explain the grievance politics of White Americans in the Trump era.","[Dawkins, Ryan] Carleton Coll, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Nemerever, Zoe; Munis, B.

Examples include Indigenous communities like Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Ontario or Beaver Lake Cree Nation in Alberta; predominantly Black communities in rural Nova Scotia; and poor neighbourhoods in urban cities like Toronto or Vancouver. Such communities face disproportionate environmental burdens due to their proximity to landfills, fossil fuel infrastructure, plastic pollution, and toxic waste. This proximity causes harrowing health effects that would otherwise not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada. Although these inequalities stem from a number of interrelated factors, the role of the state in regulating (and facilitating) polluting activity is key. Across jurisdictions, ministries grant pollution permits to new and existing facilities based on deficient regulatory standards laid out under environmental protection legislation. Ministry officials have direct control over when and where pollution occurs. This paper contends that the inequality that results from these regulatory frameworks triggers constitutional scrutiny under section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is an example of adverse effects discrimination from a legislative framework that appears neutral on its face. Although the application of section 15 to environmental inequality is underexplored, recent developments in the jurisprudence suggest that remedying adverse (environmental) effects discrimination may be more viable than ever. This viability stems from the majority decision in Fraser v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28, which introduced significant flexibility into the causation and evidentiary requirements needed to establish adverse effects discrimination under the section. Under the new framework, the popular slogan Not in Anyones Backyard might just be given room to transform from a longstanding aspiration to a new reality.",,,,,,,,,,,98,0,0,1,2,APPEAL PUBL SOC,VICTORIA,"PO BOX 2400, VICTORIA, BC V8W 3H7, CANADA",1205-612X,1925-4938,,APPEAL,Appeal,,2022,27,,,,,,19,41,,,,,,23,Law,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Government & Law,5C7UT,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000864461500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods This study provides a narrative review of the literature on psychosis in these populations, including issues related to the provision of early intervention services for psychosis. Results Migrant status has long been reported as a significant risk factor for psychosis in many geographic contexts. This increased risk among migrants seems to persist beyond the first generation and has been found to be higher in all migrant populations, but especially for black ethnic minorities and individuals migrating from economically developing countries to developed ones. Recent evidence suggests that this higher risk is at least in part due to migrants' and minorities' cumulative exposure to social adversities, such as racial discrimination, marginalization and socio-economic disadvantage. Systemic racism affects migrant and minority populations by creating bias in diagnostic practices and aggravating treatment disparities in addition to contributing to causation of psychosis. Furthermore, migrant and ethnic minority groups are known to seek mental healthcare after longer delays, to be more frequently forcibly hospitalized, to disengage from treatment prematurely and to be less satisfied with their treatment. The consideration of social and cultural context and factors is essential to the provision of good healthcare, especially in a culturally diverse society. Furthermore, acknowledging power relationships that stem from the societal context and shape institutions and models of care is a key step towards structural competence and safety in mental healthcare. Several strategies have been proposed to make mental healthcare services and systems more culturally and structurally competent. These include the use of interpreters and cultural brokers, tailored assessments and specialised cultural interventions. However, these strategies have yet to be adopted broadly in early intervention for psychosis. Conclusion Given its emphasis on meaningful engagement and person-centered care, early intervention should integrate inclusive, structurally competent and context-informed interventions as a priority. Efforts must be made to apply knowledge from and adapt the tools of social and cultural psychiatry to the field of early intervention in psychosis. Sociocultural considerations, hitherto inconsistently applied in psychosis research and service design in Quebec, are especially relevant to the province given its distinct linguistic context, its increasing cultural diversity, and its ongoing effort to systematize and expand the delivery of early intervention services.","[Xavier, Salome M.; Jarvis, G.

However, successful completion of bridging programs does not always correlate with university enrolment for Indigenous students. This paper offers a pedagogical rationale for an Indigenous bridging program that aims to address this discrepancy. The program curriculum challenges deficit myths about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and education, while developing foundational academic skills for university study. Leveraging transformative learning and cultural interface theories, the program aims to empower students with the opportunity to develop their own narratives about Indigeneity and university, free from deficit stereotypes. Since implementation of this myth-busting pedagogy, Indigenous student records indicate marked improvement in bridging program pass rates and in transitions into undergraduate study. Additionally, enrolments into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) tripled. Students' weekly reflections, collected over seven iterations of the course, suggest that the transformative pedagogy developed students' self-awareness, self-efficacy, self-confidence and sense of belonging at university.","[Bennett, Rebecca; Strehlow, Karin] Murdoch Univ, Kulbardi Aboriginal Ctr, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Hill, Braden] Edith Cowan Univ, Off Pro Vice Chancellor Equ & Indigenous, Joondalup, WA, Australia",Murdoch University; Edith Cowan University,"Bennett, R (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Kulbardi Aboriginal Ctr, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",rebecca.bennett@murdoch.edu.au,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,2,"Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit, Univ Queensland",St Lucia,"Level 2, Building 4, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, Qld, AUSTRALIA",1326-0111,2049-7784,,AUST J INDIG EDUC,Aust.

To resolve this ambiguity, we examined the impact of racial resentment on support for a college-scholarship program in which program beneficiaries' race and socioeconomic class was experimentally varied. The analyses yield a potentially troubling finding: racial resentment means different things to white liberals and conservatives. Among liberals, racial resentment conveys the political effects of racial prejudice, by predicting program support for black but not white students, and is better predicted by overt measures of racial prejudice than among conservatives. Among conservatives, racial resentment appears more ideological. It is closely tied to opposition to race-conscious programs regardless of recipient race and is only weakly tied to measures of overt prejudice.

This system is rooted in centuries of social harm and inequity. This study examines trainees' professional acts of resistance to understand what trainees hope to accomplish in their resistance efforts, why they are resisting, and the tactics they use.Methods: Drawing on counter-storytelling and critical theory, we collected in-depth qualitative interviews from nine medical students and nine residents/fellows across North America. Using theoretical guidance on how to study acts of resistance, data were analysed using a combination of coding techniques to understand resistors' intentions in resisting and the tactics they used to understand what, why, and how trainees were resisting. The analysis was returned to participants for member checking.Results: Trainees described resisting systems of harm and injustice bequeathed to them by an older generation whose values and practices were reflective of a different time. Their motivations stemmed from deep-seated moral distress from the mistreatment of patients and learners. They hoped to re-envision medical education to be patient- and learner-centred. The tactics they chose depended on the level of power they had in the system and the extent to which they wished to have their efforts known.Discussion: Trainees described intentional and deliberate acts of resistance to the social harm and injustice embedded in the broader profession to re-create the profession. Given that these acts spanned a large geographical area, this study suggests that trainees may be part of a larger social movement aimed at creating widespread change within the profession.","[Wyatt, Tasha R.; Ma, Ting Lan] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Med, Bethesda, MD USA; [Jain, Vinayak] Georgetown Washington Hosp Ctr, MedStar Hlth, Dept Internal Med, Washington, DC USA; [Wyatt, Tasha R.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Ctr Hlth Profess Educ, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA,"Wyatt, TR (corresponding author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Ctr Hlth Profess Educ, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",tasha.wyatt@usuhs.edu,,"Wyatt, Tasha/0000-0002-0071-5298","As resistance researchers, our role is to always protect those carrying out resistance.

Multiculturalism frames articulations of national belonging in terms of broad moral implications and the immigration policy from which such implications stem. Paradoxically, discourses central to the multicultural ideal, such as integration and tolerance, can act to limit people's experience of social belonging by providing scope for demonstrations of Anglo-Celtic heritage as a form of symbolic capital. I explore the ways non-white young people with refugee backgrounds interpret whiteness in relation to multiculturalism and negotiate their sense of belonging in Brisbane, Australia. I discuss the link between whiteness and multiculturalism from the perspectives of these young people and demonstrate the various ways in which they interpret Australian national belonging as intrinsically linked to skin color.

Greater Black ancestry increased the likelihood that perceivers categorized biracial targets as Black and perceived targets as fitting Black prototypes (e.g., experiencing racial discrimination, possessing stereotypic traits). These results persisted, controlling for perceptions of phenotype that stem from ancestry information. Perceivers' beliefs about how society would categorize the biracial targets predicted perceptions of discrimination, whereas perceivers' beliefs about the targets' self-categorization predicted trait perceptions. The results of this study support the Black ancestry prototype model of affirmative action, which reveals the downstream consequences of Black ancestry for the distribution of minority resources (e.g., affirmative action) to biracial targets.","[Sanchez, Diana T.; Good, Jessica J.; Chavez, George] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Sanchez, DT (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Ave E,Tillett Hall 625, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",disanche@rci.rutgers.edu,"Sanchez, Diana Tomasa/GSD-6690-2022","Sanchez, Diana/0000-0002-8684-6183","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1048324] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,30,30,42,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

It described gay and straight youth working as allies to learn about themselves and each other's lives and to navigate and address interpersonal and institutional anti-LGBTQ school policies and practices. Today, the acronym is commonly parsed by Gen Z members as Gender-Sexuality Alliance to better represent the presence and needs of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming students, and their cisgender allies. Purpose of Study: We inquire how students learn about themselves and others-partially, unevenly, and, at times, uneasily-as they incorporate socially resistant gender and race identity work within their GSA school clubs. Participants: Participants were cisgender (n = 10) and transgender and nonbinary (n = 10), racially diverse high school students in GSAs between 14 and 18 years of age. Research Design: Our analysis is grounded in critical pragmatism, a methodological integration of critical theory and pragmatism, which stems from reflexive immersion in the research context and use of empirical inquiry as a tool to acknowledge and guide transformation of entrenched anti-trans oppression in schools, noting that racism, among other forms of structural inequality, is built into schools. We analyzed the interview component of a larger mixed-methods research study conducted by the GLSEN Research Institute, which was intended to generate insight about student and advisor experiences of GSAs. Findings: Our study reveals that while GSAs can be a space for marginalized LGBTQ students to create a collective empowering identity, they can also be a space where some differences may be flattened or left out. We explore how students make visible racial and gender identity groups during GSA activities that are often erased in secondary schools. This implicitly and explicitly entails deploying identity as a challenge to a school's heteronormative, cisnormative, and white-dominant official curriculum, although the depth or complexity of a GSA's visibility-based education and critique may be inadequate, given available resources. Our findings demonstrate how GSA students leverage their identity as a goal when mobilizing themselves and their peers to alter a school's norms and practices. Conclusions: Gen Z GSA students have begun to reimagine their clubs as if they were built from the ground up, with the needs of transgender students and students of color placed at their center. GSAs remain a critical but underdeveloped resource for learning how to recognize and challenge intersectional forms of interpersonal and institutional marginalization.","[Adelman, Madelaine] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Nonnenmacher, Sean] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Borman, Bailey] Arizona State Univ, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Kosciw, Joseph G.] GLSEN, New York, NY USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Adelman, M (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Transformat, Campus Box 4308, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",mad@asu.edu,,,,,,,84,2,5,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0161-4681,1467-9620,,TEACH COLL REC,Teach.

We developed a series of computing courses and trained public school teachers from participating middle and high schools during the Summer of 2020. More than 60 school teachers were trained to teach CRP infused computing courses. All teachers are from districts with high percentages of underrepresented racial minority ( URM) students in a Southern State in the U.S. The data collection process is two-fold. First, we conducted interviews with the teachers after the summer training. Second, we are in the process of conducting classroom observations and the second round of interviews with teachers regarding their post-training teaching experiences. The CRP theory, White racial frame, and colorblind racism are used as theoretical frameworks to interpret the data. Preliminary results revealed that some teachers tend to understand cultural differences from a color-blind perspective. The understanding of CRP may be influenced by teachers' backgrounds and characteristics. Due to the limitation of resources, teachers often find it difficult to enrich their teaching by adding individualized culturally relevant components beyond what is included in the curriculum. Our study will make theoretical contributions as well as policy implications benefiting CRP implementation in computing classrooms. Our findings will reveal critical challenges teachers face when teaching CRP infused computing courses to URM students; thus will generate practical recommendations to design and improve relevant curriculum development and professional training.","[Chen, Yu; Whidden, Alicia; El-Farrah, Mahannah] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Educ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Martin, Lori] Louisiana State Univ, African & African Amer Studies, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Martin, Lori] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Sociol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Underwood, John] East Baton Rouge Parish Sch Syst, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Alegre, Fernando] Louisiana State Univ, Gordon A Cain Ctr STEM Literacy, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Moreno, Juana] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Moreno, Juana] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Chen, Y (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Sch Educ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",yuchen@lsu.edu; lorim@lsu.edu; junderwood1@thrschools.org; falegre@brbytes.org; awhidd3@lsu.edu; melfar1@lsu.edu; moreno@brbytes.org,"Moreno, Juana/D-5882-2012",,"NSF Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships program [CNS-I923573]; U.S. Department of Education, Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program [U411CI90287]","NSF Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships program; U.S. Department of Education, Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program","This research project is funded by the NSF Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships program (CNS-I923573) and the U.S. Department of Education, Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program (U411CI90287).",,20,0,1,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-4905-2,,,,2021,,,,,,,128,132,,10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620724,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620724,,,5,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Issues",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Social Issues,BU0IL,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000869715300016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data from in-depth interviews with participants were examined in conjunction with quantitative scores on the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Participants were interviewed face-to-face on a range of postdisaster experiences, including positive changes, in 2009. Participants also completed the PTGI via a telephone survey within six months of being interviewed. Most (26 out of 32) participants described experiencing PTG within the 5 domains of the PTGI, with the domains most frequently coded, in descending order, being New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Appreciation for Life, and Spiritual Change. PTG stemmed heavily from exposure to opportunities in survivors' postdisaster communities, including increased racial diversity, improved neighborhoods, and new educational and economic opportunities. Participants' frequency of all PTG codes was associated with their overall PTGI scores with a small-to-moderate effect size (r=.32; p=.078) in a relationship that trended toward significance. Without minimizing the catastrophic losses they entail, disasters may in some cases create spaces for PTG for survivors, including through new opportunities in areas where survivors formerly experienced oppression. Policymakers should examine how to make such opportunities available, visible and accessible to individuals absent a disaster. Public Policy Relevance Statement This study suggests that although natural disasters disproportionately negatively impact individuals with oppressed statuses predisaster-for example, in the United States, women, Blacks, and low-income individuals are much more severely harmed by disasters-in some cases, natural disasters and subsequent relocation can also shake loose some of the entrenched structures of oppression and allow for posttraumatic growth (PTG) related to a reduction in experiences of race-, gender-, and socioeconomic-based oppression. This study highlights that along with more intra-and interpersonally driven growth in the 4 PTG domains of Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Appreciation for Life, and Spiritual Change, Hurricane Katrina precipitated PTG in the New Possibilities domain for our participants that was related to postdisaster experiences of greater equality. Policymakers, clinicians, and others should be attentive to ways in which the aftermath of disasters can provide space to create, and to make visible and accessible, opportunities for oppressed and underserved populations aimed at reducing the impact of racism, sexism and poverty-related oppression. More broadly, this study points to the pressing need to create such policies, absent a trauma or disaster, to assist individuals facing the same obstacles as our participants in accessing similar opportunities.","[Manove, Emily E.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge Hlth Alliance, 26 Cent St, Somerville, MA 02143 USA; [Lowe, Sarah R.; Bonumwezi, Jessica] Montclair State Univ, Dept Psychol, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Preston, Justin; Rhodes, Jean E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Waters, Mary C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Cambridge Health Alliance; Montclair State University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Harvard University,"Manove, EE (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge Hlth Alliance, 26 Cent St, Somerville, MA 02143 USA.",emanove@gmail.com,,,,,,,76,15,35,3,25,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0002-9432,1939-0025,,AM J ORTHOPSYCHIAT,Am.

The objective of this commentary is to underscore the importance of diversity and to offer initiative ideas, which should be centered around inequity stemming from the widespread historical and contemporary maldistribution of power (e.g., decision-making) and resources (e.g., funding) within institutions and organizations. Nonexhaustive strategies could include SER becoming an opportunity and information hub that helps to fill resource gaps. It is also recommended that SER leadership learn from existing associations and scientific initiatives to improve the culture of science in general by equitably incorporating policy, systems, and environmental interventions throughout the career spectrum. Examples include the provision of tools and incentives to address explicit or implicit biases, enhance mentoring skills, and remove predictable barriers (e.g., financial). Explicitly labeling diversity/inclusion efforts should be avoided, and the initiative should be evaluated based on impact rather than intent.

These are the main research questions we asked through semistructured interviews conducted in Mandarin of 15 undergraduate students from China studying in STEM, social sciences, and humanities in a public research university on the West Coast. We hypothesize that the formation of racial attitudes of U.S. undergraduate students from China is influenced by their own upbringing in China as well as personal experiences of discrimination, local school context, interracial contacts, media exposure, and classroom learning of U.S. racial history on both sides of the Pacific. These experiences, in turn, help structure their perceptions of the dominant ideology, racial beliefs, and race-based policy preferences in the host society of the United States. Our findings confirm prior research on racial learning but also offer new insights on the contours and sources of racial policy opinion on affirmative action in college admissions.","[Lien, Pei-te] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Polit Sci Affiliated Asian Amer Studies Feminist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lien, PT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Polit Sci Affiliated Asian Amer Studies Feminist, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",plien@polsci.ucsb.edu,,"Lien, Pei-te/0000-0003-1708-1567",Chang Ching-Kou Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange,Chang Ching-Kou Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange,I would like to thank the Chang Ching-Kou Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange for funding the larger project.,,42,1,2,4,9,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1938-8926,1938-8934,,J DIVERS HIGH EDUC,J.

This paper considers the links between poverty, ethnicity and gender and school attainment and the interrelations of these factors using national data sets and other quantitative data. The limitations of single-theme analyses and their potentially misleading implications are explored. Related to this, the failures of social and educational policies to bring about greater equality are examined. Competing perspectives on low attainment and their positions are critiqued. The paper argues that ethnic and class discrimination stems from the same structural arrangements contrived for the advantage of more affluent sectors of society. Theoretical development is needed to bring together class, race and other discriminatory features and construct more sophisticated causal analyses that relate to the web of economic, status and power regimes and the negative processes of 'racialisation'.","[Parsons, Carl] Univ Greenwich, Fac Hlth & Educ, London SE9 2UG, England",University of Greenwich,"Parsons, C (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Fac Hlth & Educ, London SE9 2UG, England.",c.parsons@gre.ac.uk,,,,,,,85,6,10,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-764X,1469-3577,,CAMB J EDUC,Camb.

The marches are a symbolic display of women's distress about living in fear of violence. It is a critique of society's inability to handle the problem of prevailing gendered power relations and the unequal access to city spaces that stem from these. The aim of this paper is to examine feminist struggles to challenge gendered spatial power relations, focusing on Take Back the Night mobilization. Hence, this qualitative study focuses Take Back the Night demonstrations as a phenomenon and as an actual spatial strategy, by analysing representations regarding Take Back the Night in Sweden at large, and in Malmo, Sweden's third largest city, in particular. We discuss feminist efforts to create temporary safe spaces in terms of the demonstrations' emancipatory potential and how these spatial claims provoke resistance.

Based on the analysis of the lived experiences of two immigrant mothers of color (IMC), who had transitioned into certified English Language Learner (ELL) teachers, the researcher proposes a transformative frame, which stems from Crenshaw's (1989) intersectionality and Mezirow's (1990) transformative learning. The data sources include the two immigrant mothers' oral stories told at an ELL parent panel, their written teaching philosophy statements, and blog posts. The findings contribute to the knowledge base of teacher preparation in TESOL and applied linguistics by foregrounding the racially othered experiences of IMC; envisioning intersectionality as an agentive tool for negotiation, emancipation, and advocacy; and proposing a transformative frame for TESOL teacher education. The researcher calls for considerations of using intersectionality for transforming the teaching practices and ideologies in teacher preparation programs and K-12 schools.","[LEE-JOHNSON, Y. I. N. L.

Civilised Europeans constantly tried to distance themselves from these wild and despised people. The European cultured man was supposedly all that the Gypsies were not. To distance oneself from the Gypsies allegedly emphasised the basic civilisational difference, their lack of culture, moral depravity and destructive hatred towards civilisation. Stories about Gypsies are actually stories of despise. Europeans pushed them into a world of the Other, persecuted their wild way of life, excluded and stigmatised them. They saw them as a maladjusted, filthy rabble of parasites, idlers, criminals, thieves, swindlers, beggars and vagrants. According to Grellmann (1787), supposedly these people have been known as robbers and criminals ever since they have first appeared in Europe; therefore we do not only feel aversion and disgust towards them, but also hatred With their presence the abnormal Gypsies supposedly infected the political, social and moral. order. Morals, behaviour and habits, state system and religion of other people were allegedly incomprehensible to the Gypsies, whose nature was seen as completely different from any cultured man. Virtuous bourgeoisie reproached them with being dirty, uncultured, and foul. Thus they were loathed and despised. As disgusting and unwanted intruders they were seen as contaminating the normal, civilised society, its culture, morality, order, laws and regulations, norms and customs, values and ideals. Even in case of illness the Gypsies would purportedly refuse to give up their five way of life and thievery. With their nomadic way of life and the inherent aspiration for stealing and begging they allegedly transmitted infectious diseases. So the upstanding Europeans saw them as dangerous, because they compared them with migratory birds, spreading all kinds of diseases during their travels. In the end of the 19th century Hans Gross, father of modern criminology, argued that the Gypsies' inherent inclination towards theft stemmed from their thousand-year-long habit of living on account of others. He advocated the idea of a radical separation between the culturally-evolved respectable Europeans and the Gypsies. At a certain point in the past their paths supposedly diverged. While the first group invested all of its efforts into cultural, social and metaphysical progress, Gypsies only stuck to their parasitic habits. This specific evolution also gave them an important and decisive advantage in comparison with ordinary criminals. Furthermore, the Gypsies supposedly had an excruciatingly repulsive, unforgettable odour, reminiscent of what was also deemed as a very characteristic smell of black people. Ideas about the abhorrent stench, steaming from the dirty and uncombed bodies of the Gypsies, corresponded to the period of bourgeois hygiene, counting especially filth among the primary elements of repugnance. The stench of the Gypsies was also associated with the colour of their skin. Already since their arrival to Europe they were seen as black due to their alleged Egyptian origins, just like the wild and loathsome Africans or negroes, and were thus counted among the peoples of the lowest level. Therefore they were compared, for example, with the Hottentots, who had been regularly depicted as the lowest human race or the transitional race between man and ape ever since the early enlightenment. The image of the black African Gypsy remained deeply ingrained in the cultural memory, persisting even after the theory of the Gypsies originating in India established itself around the year 1800 and the Gypsies were predominantly class fled as belonging to the Oriental-Asian type of olive-brown Indians. With the discovery of the Indian pariahs a triangle of despised peoples was in fact created As it was, pariahs, resisting civilisation, represented convenient ancestors of Gypsies according to the equivalent principle. In turn; pariahs were once again compared to the African negroes. Meanwhile the racist comparison with the Hottentots and later pariahs helped demonstrate the foreign origin or strangeness and aberration of Gypsies in Europe. The unchristian diet of the Gypsies was also seen as especially repugnant. Their eating of carrion, whose unpleasant odour and taste resulted in profound aversion in the civilised people due to their numerous prejudices, was supposedly most obnoxious. The ingestion of carrion or the very contact with it represented severe danger in the eyes of the Europeans due to its capacity to pollute, infect and poison. Allegedly the Gypsies truly enjoyed eating carrion, which was incompatible with the essential characteristics and values at the highest level of civilisation. Towards the end of the 19th century the racist attitude to the Gypsies as an antisocial gang of savages kept strengthening, forming a paranoid language of aggressive defence from infection or fear of mixing with this supposed brood of pariahs, unproductive parasites and criminals, which purportedly threatened racial purity. In the Habsburg Monarchy ideas even appeared about deporting the degenerate Gypsies to penal colonies. A possibility of forming such a colony on one of the islands in the Adriatic was in fact considered, but the concept was not realised.","Inst Contemporary Hist, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",,"Studen, A (corresponding author), Inst Contemporary Hist, Kongresni Trg 1, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",andrej.studen@inz.si,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,18,"UNIV PRIMORSKA, SCI RES CENTRE KOPER",KOPER,"GARIBALDIJEVA 1, KOPER, CAPODISTRIA SI-6000, SLOVENIA",1318-0185,,,ACTA HISTRIAE,Acta Histriae,,2015,23,1,,,,,97,112,,,,,,16,History,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History,CP4VA,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000359879500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Young people often do not appear to be too much concerned by such issues. This represents a formidable educational challenge. This view-point is also shared by the Ministers of Education of the European Union. In fact, as the European Commission refers, the Paris Declaration was adopted in March 2015 to promote citizenship, and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education. In this context it is very important for teachers and students to have access to educational tools that help to inform, educate, explain and question issues of national and European citizenship, such as multiculturalism, tolerance and mutual respect. Thus, youngsters may become more aware of their roles and responsibilities, a mandatory pre-condition for the creation of a more inclusive and tolerant European society. Three non-governmental associations - le Partenariat (France), Studio Globo (Belgium) and Stedenband Haarlem-Mutare (Netherlands) - and three higher education institutions - Dundalk Institute of Technology (Ireland), Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen (Belgium) and ISPGaya - Instituto Superior Politecnico (Portugal) - were awarded a grant, under KA203 Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership, to contribute to the creation of a European society which is more inclusive and respectful of all, by educating and empowering young people and their teachers about multiculturalism. The project, started in September 2016, implied the achievement of several operational objectives. The first, and most relevant one, involved the creation of a serious game for students in secondary schools to use in class. The second was directed towards the training of teachers, so that they themselves can bring awareness to their students and thus increase the impact of the project. The third was to link and empower high-school students, university students and teachers in the different partner countries, so that they can discuss relevant topics and create, if needed, new game content. Finally, all three objectives needed to be disseminated to potential users, so that the entire project can continue to evolve. In order to achieve this, two international project camps were organised. In these short-term mobilities, international and interdisciplinary teams of students - from the above mentioned higher education institutions - with proper supervision from mentors/professors/experts, were challenged to design and develop a serious game. After its completion, the serious game was presented to the interested parties, students and teachers from secondary schools. Students and teachers played the game during proper lessons, where the teachers were supported by the teacher's project manual. Additional insights/feedback/comments were used in order to improve both game and manual. Finally, the content produced was made available to all for use. In the present article, with the project just finished, a detailed game description and a thorough project narrative is provided. A description of its main objectives, the methodology used to implement it and to monitor it, the tools used to assess it, and the main outcomes stemming from it.","[Monteiro, J.

Qualitative data were collected from 110 STEM students (95% BAME and 75% female) and 20 staff (70% BAME and 80% female) from Universities in the West Midlands and London via one-to-one interviews and focus groups. Questions were developed across themes of support, inclusivity, and development. Transcripts were subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Key findings included: the need for cultural awareness and representation within student support services and pastoral care provision and tailored support for students who were the first in their families to attend university. Students also felt the academic staff disproportionally represent their backgrounds, leading to a sense of not belonging amongst BAME students. BAME staff felt like tokens for diversity and reported having higher workloads than White staff, the social drinking culture felt isolating, participants felt that all staff should engage with cultural/religious training and diversity of academic staff should be improved through inclusive recruitment practices and mentoring. The results highlight the need for access to academic and pastoral support that is culturally sensitive to all backgrounds.","[Rana, Karan S.; Bashir, Amreen; Begum, Fatehma; Bartlett, Hannah] Aston Univ, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England",Aston University,"Rana, KS (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England.",k.rana2@aston.ac.uk,,"Bartlett Eperjesi, Hannah E/0000-0002-7531-6902; Rana, Karan Singh/0000-0003-3061-5156; Bashir, Amreen/0000-0002-0428-0922",,,,,56,4,5,4,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2504-284X,,FRONT EDUC,Front.

While the diversity of students in graduate programs has steadily increased, faculty diversity, particularly in the biomedical sciences, continues to remain relatively flat. Several issues contribute to this mismatch between the pipeline and the professoriate including biases in search and hiring practices, lack of equity and equal opportunities for individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, and unwelcoming campus climates that lead to marginalization and isolation in academic life. A comprehensive approach that addresses these challenges is necessary for institutions of higher education to achieve their faculty diversity goals and create a climate where individuals from all groups feel welcomed and succeed. This article focuses on the first step in this approach-diversifying faculty recruitment through adopting search practices that generate an applicant pool that matches national availability, ensures equity in evaluation and hiring practices, and promotes inclusion and belonging in the hiring experience. These strategies have been recently used at the University of California, Irvine's School of Biological Sciences and while the long-term impact remains unknown, short-term outcomes in recruitment and hiring have demonstrated significant improvement over previous years.","[Yassa, Michael A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, 320 Qureshey Res Lab, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Edinger, Aimee L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Dev & Cell Biol, 2136 Nat Sci 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Yassa, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, 320 Qureshey Res Lab, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Edinger, AL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Dev & Cell Biol, 2136 Nat Sci 1, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",michael.yassa@uci.edu; aedinger@uci.edu,,"Edinger, Aimee/0000-0003-4277-4584",,,,,45,0,0,11,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0892-6638,1530-6860,,FASEB J,Faseb J.,NOV,2023,37,11,,,,,,,e23224,10.1096/fj.202300688RR,http://dx.doi.org/10.1096/fj.202300688RR,,,19,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology,T9FF1,37779389,hybrid,,,2024-04-30,WOS:001080961300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Proposed housing developments frequently trigger concern among neighbors and community groups about potential negative impacts on neighborhood quality of life and property values. Advocates, developers, and researchers have long suspected that these concerns stem in part from racial or class prejudice. Yet, to date, empirical evidence supporting these assumptions is lacking. This study seeks to examine roles that perceptions of race and class play in shaping opinions that underlie public opposition to affordable housing. This study applies a public opinion survey to determine the extent to which stereotypes and perceptions of the poor and minorities relate to attitudes toward affordable housing. The results demonstrate that such perceptions are particularly strong determinants of negative attitudes about affordable housing. These findings provide advocates, planners, developers, and researchers with a more accurate portrayal of affordable housing opposition, thereby allowing the response to be shaped in a more appropriate manner.","Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Tighe, JR (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",tighejr@appstate.edu,"Tighe, Rosie/G-6660-2013","Tighe, Rosie/0000-0002-4885-4369",,,,,87,40,57,8,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0267-3037,1466-1810,,HOUSING STUD,Hous.

Meeting the needs of those most burdened by this disparity will require swift and tactical action in partnership with these communities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a community-based participatory research approach was employed to assess the priorities and needs of four communities of color (African immigrant, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and Pacific Islander) in a major U.S. city. A brief quantitative survey devised jointly by community leaders and the research team was deployed to community members (N = 59) in the fall of 2020. The most endorsed mental health issues across the communities were excessive worry (51%) and stress regarding COVID-19, racism, and immigration policies (49%). The most endorsed physical health concerns included sleep difficulties (44%), headaches, and backaches (each 39%). Physical symptoms predicted the endorsement of a mental health issue above and beyond COVID-19-related hardships, multiplying the odds of reporting an issue by 1.73 per physical health concern endorsed. Based on these findings, the community-research team conceptualized and proposed an evidence-based, effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-2 intervention approach for chronic worry and daily stress. This paper highlights detail on how the community-research team arrived at the proposed multilevel intervention that addresses community-stated barriers to mental health treatment (e.g., preferring trusted health workers to deliver emotional health treatments) and considers the burden of the additional stressful context of COVID-19. Lay Summary Diverse community members and university researchers collaborated on the development of an equitable intervention approach for community members' mental health needs.","[Chavez, Manuel Gutierrez; Kaur, Kiran; Baucom, Katherine J.

In the current review, we update the theoretical record by discussing traditional views of, as well as recent developments to, the 3 prominent frameworks used to understand diversity: social categorization, similarity-attraction, and information and decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a dual pathway model of diversity's effects that integrates all 3 frameworks. In our model, both positive and detrimental effects of diversity stem from processes of social categorization. Whereas these processes disrupt group functioning when intergroup bias is activated, when bias is not activated, we propose that social categorization and reduced attraction to dissimilar others will allow individuals in diverse rather than homogeneous groups to focus more on the task, anticipate differences in task-relevant opinions and perspectives, and engage in more effortful information processing.

In this framework, punishment is an artifact of unconscious and symbolic forces whose structuration can be positionally, relationally and provisionally decoded through careful textual exegeses. Linked to several strains of postmodern inquiry, a number of application studies have examined the varied sociological and criminological contexts in which this phenomenon operates; including the reality construction undertaken by legal and psychiatric decision brokers and tribunals. However, one under-investigated dimension to this critical theory of punishment is found within popular media portrayals, including reality-based television programming. This study explores the intertextual construction and situated meaning of mental illness derived from the acclaimed television show, COPS. By appropriating the methodological tools of discourse analysis, this article describes the richly detailed, constitutive order lurking behind and through one excerpted police-citizen (P-C) encounter. At issue here is the dialogical function of fear and laughter, and the manner in which each uniquely functioned to transform the phenomenon of mental illness into the sign of punishment, expressed through harms of reduction and repression. Several social and justice policy implications stemming from this inquiry also are described.","Indiana State Univ, Dept Criminol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Criminal Justice, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Indiana State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Indiana State Univ, Dept Criminol, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.",,,,,,,,128,3,4,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1462-4745,1741-3095,,PUNISHM SOC,Punishm.

Most production occurs in the remote, rural, far-northern counties where farms may be hours by vehicle from the nearest town. While licenses for cannabis cultivation became available following legalization in California for adult recreational use in 2016, most cannabis- about 80%-is still grown on unlicensed farms. Cannabis is a labor-intensive crop, and the skilled and time-consuming task of hand-trimming flow-ers is the most common seasonal job in the indus-try. Some immigrant workers return for multiple cannabis harvest seasons and are attracted to the work by an interest in the cannabis culture and consumption or the opportunity to earn enough money in several months to live the rest of the year in their home country. Others are farmworkers moving from work in traditional crops for the rela-tively higher pay in the cannabis industry. Seasonal cannabis workers are exposed to many of the phys-ical hazards found in all agricultural workplaces, like dust, pesticides, and injuries; another common-ality with California's traditional agricultural work-force is vulnerability to structural violence stem-ming from factors related to race, gender, immigra-tion status, and employer/employee power imbal-ance. Cannabis workers are also uniquely affected by the intersections of these structural factors with the isolated and remote nature of cannabis farms and the ongoing criminalization of the industry. In this article we present the results of a qualitative study of the occupational health and safety of Mexican and South American immigrant seasonal cannabis workers who have previous cannabis -industry-specific skills and experience. Workers were recruited using a peer-recruitment method, with 25 participants in three online focus group discussions on a range of occupational health and safety topics. This qualitative descriptive analysis is focused on experiences of structural violence and wage theft.","[Beckman, Stella] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Hlth & Environm, Davis, CA USA; [Beckman, Stella] Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Occupat Hlth Branch, 850 Marina Bay Pkwy,Bldg P,3rdFloor, Richmond, CA 94804 USA; [Castaneda, Xochitl] Univ Calif Berkeley, Hlth Initiat Amer, Berkeley, CA USA; [del Rivero, Vania] Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Colegio Geog, Fac Filosofia & Letras, Mexico City, Mexico; [Chavez, Anaisabel] Yale Univ, Yale Coll, New Haven, CT USA; [Schenker, Marc B.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Publ Hlth Sci & Med, Davis, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; California Department of Public Health; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Yale University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Beckman, S (corresponding author), Calif Dept Publ Hlth, Occupat Hlth Branch, 850 Marina Bay Pkwy,Bldg P,3rdFloor, Richmond, CA 94804 USA.",stella.beckman@cdph.ca.gov,,"Beckman, Stella/0000-0002-7483-6973","California Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Cannabis Control [65322]","California Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Cannabis Control","Funding Disclosure Grant sponsor: California Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Cannabis Control; Grant number: 65322.",,53,1,1,3,3,LYSON CENTER CIVIC AGRICULTURE & FOOD SYSTEMS,ITHACA,"295 HOOK PL, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA",2152-0798,2152-0801,,J AGRIC FOOD SYST CO,J.

It presents a geography of Islamophobia in Paris based on statistical data, and aims to observe whether or not this geography corresponds or contrasts with geographies of inequality (such as those associated with gentrification, deprivation and marginalisation), by analysing the various spatial patterns stemming from the maps. This socio-spatial analysis of anti-Muslim discrimination is important in Paris because since the terrorist attacks in 2015, anti-Muslim sentiment has increased sharply. The mapping of Islamophobia and its association with the spatial distribution of different socioeconomic and demographic variables synthetized in a typological map display significant forms, relations and diversities within Paris. This cartographic analysis demonstrates that the geography of Islamophobia does not necessarily refer to spaces where 'Muslims' and the victims of Islamophobia live in great majority, and rather refers to more privileged and central areas such as Paris intra-muros. Victims mostly experience anti-Muslim incidents outside their everyday spaces away from their homes, such as public institutions and workplaces. Indeed, the findings raise the significance of the exact place where incidents occur as well as societal attitudes to these 'hierarchical' places where the perpetrator probably feels more comfortable in behaving in an antisocial and sometimes violent way.","[Najib, Kawtar] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Najib, K (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Kawtar.Najib@ncl.ac.uk,,"Najib, Kawtar/0000-0002-7348-112X",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Commission through a H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship [Horizon 2020-MSCA-IF-2015-703328SAMA (Spaces of Anti-Muslim Acts)].",,90,8,8,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2399-6544,2399-6552,,ENVIRON PLAN C-POLIT,Env.

This article hopes to highlight the underlying etiology for this effect and possible mitigations including emphasis on mHealth as well as the future of telemedicine.","[Listernick, Zoe, I] Ann & Robert H Lurie Childrens Hosp Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [Listernick, Zoe, I] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med Educ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Badawy, Sherif M.] Ann Robert H Lurie Childrens Hosp Chicago, Div Hematol Oncol & Stem Cell Transplantat, 225 E Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Badawy, Sherif M.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Pediat, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Ann & Robert H.

Results can help Medicaid non-expansion states understand health care use and costs of new enrollees in a period of enrollment growth. Research Design Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of North Carolina Medicaid claims data (January 1, 2018 - August 31, 2020). We used modified Poisson and ordinary least squares regression analysis to estimate health care use and costs as a function of personal characteristics and enrollment during COVID. Using data on existing enrollees before and during COVID, we projected the extent to which changes in outcomes among new enrollees during COVID were pandemic-related. Subjects 340,782 new enrollees pre-COVID (January 2018 - December 2019) and 56,428 new enrollees during COVID (March 2020 - June 2020). Measures We observed new enrollees for 60-days after enrollment to identify emergency department (ED) visits, nonemergent ED visits, primary care visits, potentially-avoidable hospitalizations, dental visits, and health care costs. Results New Medicaid enrollees during COVID were less likely to have an ED visit (-46 % [95 % CI: -48 %, -43 %]), nonemergent ED visit (-52 % [95 % CI: -56 %, -48 %]), potentially-avoidable hospitalization (-52 % [95 % CI: -60 %, -43 %]), primary care visit (-34 % [95 % CI: -36 %, -33 %]), or dental visit (-36 % [95 % CI: -41 %, -30 %]). They were also less likely to incur any health care costs (-29 % [95 % CI: -30 %, -28 %]), and their total costs were 8 % lower [95 % CI: -12 %, -4 %]. Depending on the outcome, COVID explained between 34 % and 100 % of these reductions. Conclusions New Medicaid enrollees during COVID used significantly less care than new enrollees pre-COVID. Most of the reduction stems from pandemic-related changes in supply and demand, but the profile of new enrollees before versus during COVID also differed.","[Wright, Brad] Univ N Carolina, Dept Family Med, 590 Manning Dr,NC CB 7595, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Wright, Brad] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Anderson, David; Whitaker, Rebecca; Bettger, Janet Prvu; Wong, Charlene] Duke Margolis Ctr Hlth Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Shrader, Peter] Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Bettger, Janet Prvu] Duke Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Durham, NC USA; [Wong, Charlene] Duke Univ, Dept Pediat, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Shafer, Paul] Boston Univ, Dept Hlth Law Policy & Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Boston University,"Wright, B (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Family Med, 590 Manning Dr,NC CB 7595, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.;Wright, B (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",brad_wright@med.unc.edu,"Anderson, David/ABA-5531-2022; Wright, Brad/HTR-4468-2023","Anderson, David/0000-0003-4524-2479; Wright, Brad/0000-0002-2674-4951; Shafer, Paul/0000-0003-0654-5821",Kate B.

This study extends this literature by exploring connections between anticipation of racially motivated police brutality and multiple facets of adolescent mental health. Methods: Students ages 14 to 18 (n = 151) were recruited from a study administered in Baltimore City public schools. Between December 2020 and July 2021, participants completed a questionnaire assessing anticipatory stress regarding racially motivated police brutality and current mental health. Regression models examined associations between this anticipatory stress and mental health. Latent profile and regression analyses were used to examine whether anticipatory stress was more salient among adolescents with comorbid mental health symptoms, compared to those without comorbid symptoms.Results: Youth with anticipatory stress stemming from both personal and vicarious police brutality had more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, as well as lower hope, compared to youth without anticipatory stress. The association between anticipatory stress and anxiety was stronger for girls than boys.Conclusions: Findings from this study highlight racialized police brutality as a common anticipated stressor among youth, particularly for girls. Findings have implications for policing interventions, including development of additional trainings for police officers and promoting positive police/youth interactions.","[Webb, Lindsey; Mendelson, Tamar; Clary, Laura K.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Jackson, Dylan B.; Mendelson, Tamar] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Jindal, Monique] Univ Illinois, Dept Med, Acad Internal Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Alang, Sirry] Lehigh Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Bethlehem, PA USA; [Webb, Lindsey] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, 111 Market Pl,Room 8558, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Lehigh University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Webb, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, 111 Market Pl,Room 8558, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",Lwebb7@jhmi.edu,,,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [1R01HD090022, 1R01HD090022-05S1]; Institute of Education Sciences (IES) [R305A160082]",National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Institute of Education Sciences (IES)(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)),"This work was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [1R01HD090022, 1R01HD090022-05S1], and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) [R305A160082].",,114,7,8,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0047-2352,1873-6203,,J CRIM JUST,J.

Non-Hispanic blacks are disproportionately affected by incarceration and criminal law enforcement, an enduring legacy of a racially-biased criminal justice system with broad health implications for black families and communities. Louisiana has consistently maintained one of the highest rates of black incarceration in the nation. Concurrently, large racial disparities in population health persist. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all births among non-Hispanic black women in Louisiana in 2014 to identify associations between parish-level (county equivalent) prevalence of jail incarceration within the black population and adverse birth outcomes (N = 23,954). We fit a log-Poisson model with generalized estimating equations to approximate the relative risk of preterm birth and low birth weight associated with an interquartile range increase in incarceration, controlling for confounders. In sensitivity analyses, we additionally adjusted for the parish-level index crime prevalence and analyzed regression models wherein white incarceration was used to predict the risk of adverse birth outcomes in order to quantify the degree to which mass incarceration may harm health above and beyond living in a high crime area. Results There was a significant 3% higher risk of preterm birth among black women associated with an interquartile range increase in the parish-level incarceration prevalence of black individuals, independent of other factors. Adjusting for the prevalence of index crimes did not substantively change the results of the models. Conclusion Due to the positive significant associations between the prevalence of black individuals incarcerated in Louisiana jails and estimated risk of preterm birth, mass incarceration may be an underlying cause of the persistent inequities in reproductive health outcomes experienced by black women in Louisiana. Not only are there economic and social impacts stemming from mass incarceration, but there may also be implications for population health and health inequities, including the persistence of racial disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight.","[Dyer, Lauren; Vilda, Dovile; Theall, Katherine; Wallace, Maeve] Tulane Univ, Dept Global Community Hlth & Behav Sci, Mary Amelia Douglas Whited Community Womens Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, 1440 Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Hardeman, Rachel] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Tulane University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Dyer, L (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Global Community Hlth & Behav Sci, Mary Amelia Douglas Whited Community Womens Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth & Trop Med, 1440 Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",ldyer3@tulane.edu,"Thomas, Belinda/AAC-6243-2020",,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health [R01HD092653]; National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health [R01HL085631, R01HL085631-S2, R01HL085631-S3]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Interdisciplinary Research Leaders program","National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Interdisciplinary Research Leaders program","This work was supported by funds from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health (R01HD092653).

This study accounts for structural inequities and assesses the relationship between early-life and later-life SES, and risk of osteoporosis diagnosis. Data come from the nationally representative, population-based cohort Health and Retirement Study and include individuals ages 50 to 90. The outcome variable is osteoporosis diagnosis. Logistic regression models of the relationship between SES and osteoporosis diagnosis are estimated, accounting for demographic, health, and childhood variables. Higher levels of childhood and adult SES link to lower odds of osteoporosis diagnosis. Structural inequities in income and underdiagnosis of osteoporosis among persons identifying as Black/African American were detected. Accounting for bone density scan access, inequities in osteoporosis diagnosis appear to stem from barriers to accessing health care due to financial constraints. The important role of SES and evidence of structural inequities leading to underdiagnosis suggest the critical importance of clinicians receiving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training to reduce health inequities.","[Courtney, Margaret Gough; Roberts, Josephine; Godde, Kanya] Univ La Verne, La Verne, CA USA; [Courtney, Margaret Gough] Univ La Verne, Sociol Anthropol Dept, 1950 Third St, La Verne, CA 91750 USA",University of La Verne; University of La Verne,"Courtney, MG (corresponding author), Univ La Verne, Sociol Anthropol Dept, 1950 Third St, La Verne, CA 91750 USA.",mgough@laverne.edu,"Godde, Kanya/AFQ-4918-2022","Godde, Kanya/0000-0001-7888-2945; Gough Courtney, Margaret/0000-0003-1352-2222",National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health [R15AG063330]; La Verne Academy Grants from the University of La Verne,National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); La Verne Academy Grants from the University of La Verne,"Thank you to Yadira Quintero, America Sanchez, and Haylie Wise who contributed as research assistants for this work.

Across four studies, college students of color (study 1: N = 160; study 2: N = 203) and Black and White people (study 3A: N = 205; study 3B: N = 394) perceived a Black man who displayed a college logo on his hoodie as significantly less likely to be seen as a criminal than when he did not. This remained true when the college logo was from a university that was objectively high in prestige (Princeton University; studies 1-2), moderate in prestige (John Jay College; study 2), or had no preexisting prestige (the fictional Pennbrook University; studies 3A and 3B). While college apparel did not consistently reduce the perceived risk that police would racially profile a Black man, an exploratory moderation analysis found that perceiving racial profiling as stemming more from individual than systemic bias lessened this perceived risk for Black but not White participants (study 3B). College apparel also indirectly predicted a lower likelihood of racial profiling through its effect on perceived criminality across all studies. Together, these results suggest that college apparel is believed to mitigate negative stereotypes associated with Black men; however, the perceived likelihood that police will racially profile a Black man is influenced by both his perceived criminality and lay theories of police bias.","[Camacho, Gabriel] CUNY, John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, New York, NY USA; [Camacho, Gabriel] John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Psychol, 524 West 59th St, New York, NY 10019 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Camacho, G (corresponding author), John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, Dept Psychol, 524 West 59th St, New York, NY 10019 USA.",gcamacho@jjay.cuny.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-1031,1096-0465,,J EXP SOC PSYCHOL,J.

This collaboration came at a time when issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion were being brought to light in science, broadly defined. Stemming from such discussions, for this special issue, the Editors asked 10 sets of authors to apply an intersectional lens - grounded in Crenshaw's (1989, 1991) definition of intersectionality and drawing from questions posed by Cole (2009) - to their systematic review of literature from the past 20 years (1992-2022) and to answer these three questions: (1) from whose vantage point is the research being conducted, (2) what types of questions are valued, and (3) who is included in the research versus who is being left out/whose voices are missing. Manuscripts in the special issue include these topics: (a) affectionate communication, health, and relationships, (b) romantic relationship maintenance behaviors, (c) relationship maintenance among military couples, (d) relational sacrifices, (e) LGBTQ-inclusive research, (f) stress, support, and coping for romantic couples, (g) daily stress and romantic relationship quality, (h) infidelity, (i) relationship dissolution, and (j) the longitudinal study of romantic close relationships. Across the reviews, authors noted many of the same patterns; most studies included samples from the U.S., wherein participants identified as White, heterosexual, and female; however, military samples were dominated by men. The methods employed were largely quantitative, cross-sectional, and/or with data coming from surveys. Observations during the review process included the role of positionality as well as greater knowledge gained about the critical framework of intersectionality, specifically acknowledging that elements of diversity in sampling methods are not an application of intersectionality; rather, intersectionality places central focus on (a) how multiply marginalized social identities have been historically oppressed and (b) how systems of power, oppression, and privilege construct, reproduce, and sustain those multiply marginalized social identities. Recommendations for future relationship science are presented, specifically in how our fields can benefit from learning from the lens of intersectionality.","[Curran, Melissa A.] Univ Arizona, Family Studies & Human Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Randall, Ashley K.] Arizona State Univ, Counseling & Counseling Psychol, Tempe, AZ USA",University of Arizona; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Curran, MA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Family Studies & Human Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,"Randall, Ashley/0000-0003-3794-4163",,,,,50,3,3,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0265-4075,1460-3608,,J SOC PERS RELAT,J.

In particular, the continued, extreme underrepresentation of People of Color in physics and a growing number of first-person accounts of the harm that People of Color experience in physics classrooms and departments speak to a system that valorizes whiteness and marginalizes People of Color. If we take Critical Race Theory as a lens, we expect that maintaining white supremacy in physics happens in part via discipline-specific instantiations of broader mechanisms that reproduce whiteness. In this study, we illustrate one such mechanism: race evasiveness, a powerful ideology that uses race-neutral discourse to explain away racialized phenomena, evading race as a shaping force in social phenomena. We offer examples from interviews with twelve university physics faculty, showing what race-evasive discourses can look like in physics and how physics epistemologies, discourses, and stories reify race-evasive frames. This work aims to support faculty in refusing race evasiveness in physics teaching and learning, toward developing race-conscious analyses that can help us challenge white supremacy in our discipline.","[Robertson, Amy D.] Seattle Pacific Univ, Dept Phys, Seattle, WA 98119 USA; [Velez, Veronica] Western Washington Univ, Woodring Coll Educ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Hairston, W.

White women and people of color remain under-represented at all levels of academic faculty, including positions of power such as departmental and institutional leadership. While the proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been cataloged previously, new programs and initiatives aimed at improving diversity, focused on institutional factors that affect equity in the geosciences, necessitate an updated study and a new metric for quantifying the biases that result in under-representation. We compile a data set of 2,531 tenured and tenure-track geoscience faculty from 62 universities in the United States to evaluate the proportion of women by rank and discipline. We find that 27% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46% of assistant professors, 34% of associate professors, and 19% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the leaky pipeline. Efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor. Our results suggest a need for 1:1 hiring between men and women to reach gender parity. Due to significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences.","[Ranganathan, Meghana; Lalk, Ellen; Freese, Lyssa M.; Freilich, Mara A.; Wilcots, Julia; Duffy, Margaret L.; Shivamoggi, Rohini] MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lalk, Ellen; Freilich, Mara A.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Ranganathan, M (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",meghanar@mit.edu,"Freilich, Mara/AAB-7207-2022","Freilich, Mara/0000-0003-0487-8518; Freese, Lyssa/0000-0003-0944-2182; Ranganathan, Meghana/0000-0002-8099-4775; Lalk, Ellen/0000-0002-9843-9278; /0000-0003-2206-2424",MIT Libraries; Houghton Fund,MIT Libraries; Houghton Fund,"The authors credit M.

This study examined factors associated with COVID-19 information-seeking behavior.Methods: An online survey was conducted with US adults (N = 1800) to identify key interpersonal (e.g., friends, health care providers) and mediated (e.g., TV, social media) sources of COVID-19 information. Logistic regression models were fitted to explore correlates of information-seeking.Results: Study findings show that the first sought and most trusted sources of COVID-19 information had different relationships with sociodemographic characteristics, perceived discrimination, and self-efficacy. Older adults had greater odds of seeking information from print materials (e.g., newspapers and magazines) and TV first. Participants with less educational attainment and greater self-efficacy preferred interpersonal sources first, with notably less preference for mass media compared to health care providers. Those with more experiences with discrimination were more likely to seek information from friends, relatives, and co-workers. Additionally, greater self-efficacy was related to increased trust in interpersonal sources.Conclusion: Study results have implications for tailoring health communication strategies to reach specific subgroups, including those more vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. A set of recommendations are provided to assist in campaign development.","[Cooks, Eric J.; Mertens, Gillian; Raisa, Aantaki; Krieger, Janice L.] Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, STEM Translat Commun Ctr, Weimer Hall 2043,POB 118400, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Vilaro, Melissa J.] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Dyal, Brenda W.; Wilkie, Diana J.; Yao, Yingwei] Univ Florida, Dept Biobehav Nursing Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wang, Shu] Univ Florida, Dept Biostat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Kim, Bumsoo] Joongbu Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Geumsan, South Korea; [Campbell-Salome, Gemme] Geisinger, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Danville, PA USA; [Odedina, Folake] Mayo Clin, Dept Quantitat Hlth Sci, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Johnson-Mallard, Versie] Kent State Univ, Coll Nursing, Kent, OH USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Joongbu University; Mayo Clinic; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Cooks, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Journalism & Commun, STEM Translat Commun Ctr, Weimer Hall 2043,POB 118400, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",cooks002@gmail.com,"Wilkie, Diana J/ABG-5417-2021","Wilkie, Diana J/0000-0002-3954-8933; Cooks, Eric/0000-0003-2310-1237; Campbell-Salome, Gemme/0000-0003-1377-5705","State of Florida; Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance (FACCA); University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC), Cancer Population Sciences research program; University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC), Biostatistics & Quantitative Sciences Shared Resource (BQS-SR); Team-based Interdisciplinary Cancer Research Training Program at the University of Florida Health Cancer Center; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) [T32 CA257923]; [U54CA233444]","State of Florida; Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance (FACCA); University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC), Cancer Population Sciences research program; University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC), Biostatistics & Quantitative Sciences Shared Resource (BQS-SR); Team-based Interdisciplinary Cancer Research Training Program at the University of Florida Health Cancer Center; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI));","Research reported in this publication was supported by the State of Florida, the Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance (FACCA), and the University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC), Cancer Population Sciences research program, and Biostatistics & Quantitative Sciences Shared Resource (BQS-SR).

However, these programs are often ineffective. To better understand less-than-desired outcomes and the shifting diversity landscape, we synthesize literature on how corporate affirmative action programs became diversity initiatives and current literature on their effectiveness. We focus specifically on work dealing with mechanisms that make diversity initiatives effective as well as their unintended consequences. When taken together, these literature point to several inequality-specific omissions in contemporary discussions of organizational diversity initiatives, such as the omission of racial inequality. As we contend in the first section of this review, without affirmative action law, which initially tasked US employers with ending racial discrimination at the workplace, we would not have diversity initiatives. We conclude by providing directions for future research and elaborating on several core foci that scholars might pursue to better (re)connect issues of organizational diversity with the aims of equity, equality and social justice.","[Portocarrero, Sandra] Columbia Univ, 606 W 122nd St Room 506, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Carter, James T.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA",Columbia University; Columbia University,"Portocarrero, S (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, 606 W 122nd St Room 506, New York, NY 10027 USA.",p.sandra@columbia.edu,,"Carter, James/0000-0002-1655-1224; Portocarrero, Sandra/0000-0001-9546-9415",National Science Foundation [1644869]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1644869] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1644869",,97,8,18,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-9020,,,SOCIOL COMPASS,Sociol.

Efforts to diversify the discipline need to address the role of hostile and exclusionary work and learning environments. A workplace climate survey distributed to five professional organizations illustrates varied experiences of earth and space scientists over a 12-month period (pre-COVID). A majority experienced positive interactions in the workplace. However, scientists of color, women and non-binary individuals, scientists with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, and asexual (LGBQPA+) scientists more frequently experienced negative interactions, including interpersonal mistreatment, discriminatory language, and sexual harassment. Geoscientists of color were more likely to experience devaluation of their work than white scientists. More than half of women and non-binary respondents, as well as those who identify as LGBQPA+ experienced identity-based discriminatory remarks. Disabled geoscientists were more likely to hear negative identity-based language than those who did not disclose a disability. Overall, 14% of all respondents experienced sexual harassment in the previous year. Rates were greatest for historically excluded groups: non-binary (51%), LGBQPA+ (33%), disabled (26%), women (20%), and geoscientists of color (17%). A majority of geoscientists reported avoiding their colleagues and almost a third considered leaving their institution or a career change. Historically excluded groups were more likely to report opting out of professional activities with potential career consequences. To address continued exclusion and low retention in the earth and space sciences, recruitment is not enough. We need to create environments that ensure opportunities for all to thrive.","[Marin-Spiotta, Erika; Diaz-Vallejo, Emily J. J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Barnes, Rebecca T.

The present study examined epistemic exclusion as another challenge in which formal institutional systems of evaluation combine with individual biases toward faculty of color to devalue their scholarship and deem them illegitimate as scholars. Using data from interviews with 118 faculty of color from a single predominantly White, research-intensive institution, we found that epistemic exclusion occurs through formal hierarchies that determine how scholarship is valued and the metrics used to assess quality, and through informal processes that further convey to faculty of color that they and their scholarship are devalued. In addition, there was variability in reporting these experiences by race, gender, nationality, and discipline. We found that faculty of color coped with epistemic exclusion by being assertive and by seeking validation and support outside the institution. Finally, participants described a number of negative work-related and psychological consequences of their epistemic exclusion. We discuss epistemic exclusion as a form of academic gatekeeping that impedes the recruitment, advancement, and retention of faculty of color and offer strategies to address this barrier.","[Settles, Isis H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Dept Afroamer & African Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Settles, Isis H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Womens Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jones, Martinque K.] Univ North Texas, Dept Psychol, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Buchanan, NiCole T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Psychol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dotson, Kristie] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Settles, IH (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, 530 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",isettles@umich.edu,"Buchanan, NiCole/K-8337-2012","Settles, Isis/0000-0001-5015-7231",ADAPP-ADVANCE office (National Science Foundation) at Michigan State University [0811205]; Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development [0811205] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,ADAPP-ADVANCE office (National Science Foundation) at Michigan State University; Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Human Resource Development(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"This research received funding from the ADAPP-ADVANCE office (National Science Foundation, Grant 0811205) at Michigan State University and from the Office for Inclusion and Intercultural Initiatives at Michigan State University.

These actions will require collective efforts supported by academic leaders and administrators to drive essential systemic change.","[Davies, Sarah W.; Bove, Colleen B.; Fulweiler, Robinson W.; Rivera, Hanny E.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Putnam, Hollie M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Ainsworth, Tracy; Parker, Laura M.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Baum, Julia K.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Crosby, Sarah C.] Earthplace Inc, Harbor Watch, Westport, CT USA; [Cote, Isabelle M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Duplouy, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Program, Helsinki, Finland; [Fulweiler, Robinson W.] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Griffin, Alyssa J.; Hill, Tessa] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Griffin, Alyssa J.; Hill, Tessa] Univ Calif Davis, Bodega Marine Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hanley, Torrance C.] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Nahant, MA USA; [Humanes, Adriana] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mangubhai, Sangeeta] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Fiji Country Program, Suva, Fiji; [Metaxas, Anna] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Silbiger, Nyssa J.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Smith, Nicola S.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Spalding, Ana K.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Sch Publ Policy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Spalding, Ana K.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama; [Traylor-Knowles, Nikki] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Weigel, Brooke L.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wright, Rachel M.] Smith Coll, Dept Biol Sci, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Bates, Amanda E.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada",Boston University; University of Rhode Island; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Victoria; Simon Fraser University; University of Helsinki; Boston University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; Northeastern University; Newcastle University - UK; Dalhousie University; California State University System; California State University Northridge; Simon Fraser University; Oregon State University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of Miami; University of Chicago; Smith College; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Davies, SW (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Putnam, HM (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.;Bates, AE (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada.",daviessw@bu.edu; hputnam@uri.edu; abates@mun.ca,"Cote, Isabelle/ABD-5898-2021; Duplouy, Anne/H-3006-2019; Smith, Nicola Simone/ISB-2787-2023; Duplouy, Anne/J-2182-2015; Putnam, Hollie M./AFJ-8174-2022; Davies, Sarah/ITT-3963-2023; Bove, Colleen/AFQ-8778-2022; Traylor-Knowles, Nikki G/D-4354-2012; Bates, Amanda E./ABD-6874-2021; Fulweiler, Robinson W./A-3806-2010; Baum, Julia K/A-4693-2008; AINSWORTH, TRACY/L-7309-2016","Duplouy, Anne/0000-0002-7147-5199; Putnam, Hollie M./0000-0003-2322-3269; Bates, Amanda E./0000-0002-0198-4537; Fulweiler, Robinson W./0000-0003-0871-4246; Hill, Tessa/0000-0003-4159-9104; Baum, Julia/0000-0002-9827-1612; Smith, Nicola S./0000-0002-1569-7790; Crosby, Sarah/0000-0001-5574-8866; Griffin, Alyssa/0000-0003-4695-8364; Bove, Colleen B./0000-0003-0340-1371; Hanley, Torrance/0000-0003-1306-8189; AINSWORTH, TRACY/0000-0001-6476-9263; Parker, Laura/0000-0003-3139-1844",,,,,130,83,85,10,59,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1544-9173,1545-7885,,PLOS BIOL,PLoS.

This chapter addresses racial and gender disparities in academic medicine and biomedical research. Racial and ethnic minorities and women remain underrepresented in medicine, biomedical research, and healthcare leadership. These disparities are national issues and have far-reaching effects which translate into significant educational and healthcare-delivery disparities. Research has shown that health care professionals from underserved backgrounds are more likely than others to work in underserved areas which would address current shortages in health professionals for the medically underserved. The authors describe their theory for the existence and persistence of these disparities. They offer evidence of these disparities while concluding with current initiatives to address these disparities, calling for innovative approaches to training underrepresented minorities and women as physicians and biomedical research scientists.","[Harp, Djana; Harp, Jamil A.] Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Shim, Ruth S.] Lenox Hill Hosp, Educ & Fac Dev, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Shim, Ruth S.] Lenox Hill Hosp, Outpatient Psychiat Serv, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Johnson, Japera] Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Community Hlth & Prevent Med, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Johnson, Japera] Morehouse Sch Med, Satcher Hlth Leadership Inst, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Wilcox, William Clyde] Georgetown Univ, Govt, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Wilcox, Judith K.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Morehouse School of Medicine; Northwell Health; Northwell Health; Morehouse School of Medicine; Morehouse School of Medicine; Georgetown University; Boston University,"Harp, D (corresponding author), Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA.",,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,13,IGI GLOBAL,HERSEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",2475-675X,2475-6768,978-1-5225-0175-6; 978-1-5225-0174-9,ADV RELIG CULT STUD,,,2016,,,,,,,115,134,,10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9.ch006,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9.ch006,10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9,,20,Ethnic Studies; Women's Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Ethnic Studies; Women's Studies,BI0ZO,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000405338000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several theories, such as critical racial theory, intersectionality, and campus climate framework, highlight the importance of examining individual characteristics and details of the environmental context. This study used data from a sample of 850 women students in 120 U.S. engineering undergraduate programs from 31 four-year institutions. Black women engineering students experienced and perceived more differential treatment because of their race/ethnicity but interacted more with faculty than White women students. This study provides critical implications for policy and practice regarding how administrators and faculty members can design engineering programs to create better climate and offer resources for women of color students.","[Ro, Hyun Kyoung] Bowling Green State Univ, Higher Educ & Student Affairs, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [McIntosh, Kadian] Univ Arizona, Arizona Med Educ Res Initiat, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; University of Arizona,"Ro, HK (corresponding author), Bowling Green State Univ, Higher Educ & Student Affairs, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",,,,,,,,94,0,0,0,10,IGI GLOBAL,HERSEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",2475-675X,2475-6768,978-1-5225-0175-6; 978-1-5225-0174-9,ADV RELIG CULT STUD,,,2016,,,,,,,23,48,,10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9.ch002,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9.ch002,10.4018/978-1-5225-0174-9,,26,Ethnic Studies; Women's Studies,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH),Ethnic Studies; Women's Studies,BI0ZO,,,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000405338000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concern is with the low representation of Black women in such roles and the reasons why some women have chosen the field and others have fled from it. The issues are related to gender and race and have been gathered from the scientific literature on Computer Science Education. Black women in Canada and the Caribbean who are on paths towards and in regular academic roles in CS were surveyed about how these issues have influenced them and their peers for or against CS in general and more specifically advanced education in Computer Science, since these such choices for CS are a requirement for regular academic roles in CS. This work delivers insights into an understudied locale for an underrepresented group in a field critical to economic development in Canada and the Caribbean.

Characteristic of the disease is a disproportionate effect on women and communities of color, both in terms of prevalence and severity of symptoms. Lupus is also both genetically driven and subject to external environmental conditions, many with place based corollaries. Thus, lupus presents a series of complex and intersecting biosocial questions regarding its origin and treatment, questions which transdisciplinary approaches are uniquely suited to address. In this paper, we propose a framework, incorporating critical approaches to the production of embodied formations of race and gender as well as new understandings of the impact of environmental conditions and lived experience at the genetic level, that can direct future research into lupus that is both more inclusive of a range of influences and more precise in its ability to treat and diagnose the disease.","[Paul, Carolyn P.; Kulathinal, Rob J.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Kinsey, Dirk; Taylor, Denina; Hayes-Conroy, Allison] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Caricchio, Rorto] Temple Univ, Lewis Katz Sch Med, Dept Med, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Kinsey, D (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",dirk.kinsey@temple.edu,"Hayes-Conroy, Allison/B-6931-2012","Hayes-Conroy, Allison/0000-0002-2506-9448; Paul-Gorsline, Carolyn/0009-0008-3120-7094",National Science Foundation (NFS) [1545309]; National Institutes of Health (NIAMS) [AR061569-01A1]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education [1545309] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NFS)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health (NIAMS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Arthritis & Musculoskeletal & Skin Diseases (NIAMS)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Graduate Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NFS #1545309); and the National Institutes of Health (NIAMS #AR061569-01A1).,,63,13,16,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1353-8292,1873-2054,,HEALTH PLACE,Health Place,MAY,2018,51,,,,,,182,188,,10.1016/j.healthplace.2018.03.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2018.03.007,,,7,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",GG6EQ,29655130,hybrid,,,2024-04-30,WOS:000432789600020,View Full Record in Web of Science
