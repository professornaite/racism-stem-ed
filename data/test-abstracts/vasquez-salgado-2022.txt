“I definitely feel like a scientist”: Exploring science identity trajectories among Latinx students in a critical race theory-informed undergraduate research experience

The current study investigated science identity develop-ment among Latinx university students selected for a criticalrace theory (CRT)-informed undergraduate research experi-ence. Twenty students (12 female, 8 male;Mage=22.00;SD=2.77) enrolled in biomedical-related majors at a 4-yearuniversity responded to open-ended questions regardingtheir identity as scientists at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 18months after they began the program. Results illustrated asteady increase in the number of students identifying as sci-entists over 18 months. At 2 weeks into the program, only35% of Latinx students felt like a scientist. At 6 months,45% of Latinx students identified as a scientist. At 18months, 70% of Latinx students reported feeling like a sci-entist. Results also revealed variation in science identity tra-jectories, with four trajectories viewed in the data:(1)consistent or fast achievement, (2)gradual achievement,(3)achievement adjustment, and (4)never reach achievement.The majority of students demonstrated a trajectory in whichthey reached science identity achievement (the feeling thatthey are“a scientist”). Our results provide evidence of the positive, longitudinal impact that a CRT-informed curricu-lum has on the science identity development of Latinx stu-dents. Implications surrounding future research andstrategies to facilitate long-term Latinx student participationin the biomedical sciences are discussed.
