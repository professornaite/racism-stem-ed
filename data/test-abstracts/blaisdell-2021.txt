Counternarrative as strategy: embedding critical race theory to develop an antiracist school identity

This article examines the purposeful use of counternarrative to develop an antiracist school identity. Based on a seven-year ethnographic project at an elementary school in the southeast U.S., it illustrates how counternarrative can be employed as strategy to embed Critical Race Theory (CRT) into school equity discourse and, in doing so, help public schools disrupt majoritarian narratives that deny the salience of race. It argues that by developing counternarratives rooted in the perspectives and knowledge of teachers of color, and then using those counternarratives specifically for the purposes of strategizing, schools and researchers can help CRT achieve its activist function in K-12 school contexts.
