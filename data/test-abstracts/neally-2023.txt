Underrepresentation of Minoritized Groups in STEM Education: The Development of a Survey

The current school system has an underrepresentation of People of Color teaching science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Presently, there is a lack of data gathering tools to explore the STEM experience of Students of Color. This article focuses on the development of a survey using a Critical Race Theory framework to better understand the impact of race on the STEM education pipeline for underrepresented, racially minoritized (URM) learners. This article will review the surveyâ€™s development process consisting of (a) creation of initial survey; (b) pilot study using interviews to receive feedback; (c) modifying the survey based on the feedback from the pilot study; and (d) implementation of the revised survey. Ultimately this instrument will support inquiry around racial representation in STEM education.
