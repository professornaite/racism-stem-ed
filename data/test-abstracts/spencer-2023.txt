Black Men vs. White Men Pursuing Undergraduate STEM Programs in the Ivory Tower: The Academic and Social Impediments Regarding Our Divergent Success

The objective of this qualitative research study was to investigate the academic and social experiences of Black men and White men currently enrolled in STEM doctoral programs who reflect back on their STEM undergraduate experiences (N = 37). Overall, this study explores the strategies they utilized to succeed despite enduring obstacles of all sorts. Utilizing both critical race theory and critical whiteness studies to further position this study, findings indicate that several White men were challenged by difficult STEM coursework, which led to them failing examinations or select courses altogether. By contrast, Black men succeeded academically but struggled to obtain faculty support as well as acquire access to various forms of academic and social capital. Additionally, both Black men and White men struggled with decreasing psychological health and well-being for distinct reasons. Black men succumbed to racial battle fatigue, acute isolation and alienation, and intellectual self-doubt due to racial prejudice. On the other hand, White men struggled psychologically because they were afraid of failing out of their STEM majors due to a lack of academic preparation. To ensure their success, both Black men and White men relied on advocating for themselves to ensure they received the support they needed, but for different reasons. White men were more likely to advocate for academic reasons (e.g., wanted particular classes to be taught), whereas Black men advocated for non-academic reasons (e.g., wanted to stop the pervasive role of racism they experienced).
