AB The racialized structure of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) higher education maintains gross inequities that are illustrative of structural racism, which both informs and is reinforced by discriminatory beliefs, policies, values, and distribution of resources. Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read "assimilate") underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating racially hostile work and educational spaces. I argue that, without a critical examination of the structural racism omnipresent in the STEM, progress in racially diversifying STEM will continue at a snail's pace.

AB If we envision a future for Black young learners where their full humanity is honoured and educators facilitate rigorous science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning experiences that are justice-focused, we must disrupt systemic racism now. In this article we discuss how anti-Blackness is pervasive in science and mathematics education, especially for young learners. We also address why teacher educators must disrupt anti-Black racism in our work with elementary teacher candidates and in our research. We argue that to do this work and disrupt anti-Blackness, elementary teacher educators and teacher candidates need political clarity (Beauboeuf-LaFontant, 1999). Political clarity is the understanding of how structural and school inequalities work to (re)produce differential learning experiences for minoritized learners. We offer suggestions for how teacher educators can further develop their teacher candidates' political clarity. Drawing upon our prior research, course assignments, and experiences as Black women educators and teacher educators, we share examples of how an individual's political clarity can be developed within science and mathematics methods courses. In doing so, we build upon prior research in STEM teacher education on how teachers come to see teaching as a political act and engage in the hard work of equity-focused STEM teaching.

AB A group of 3 African American female preservice science and science teaching students majoring in a field of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) participated in a qualitative research study to share their experiences in STEM, reasons for their choice of major, obstacles and challenges, instances of racism or sexism, and their identity development. The students participated in semistructured, face-to-face interviews. The results showed that the females were not discouraged by their underrepresentation; were confident in their abilities; and expressed wide variation in their identity development related to race, gender, and field of study. Future studies should seek deeper insights into how STEM college student identities are developed and solidified in the predominantly White and male STEM culture.

AB Teachers involved in a Master's level course in diversity participated in virtual, synchronous, anonymized discussions around issues of ethnic and racial diversity, gender, and stereotypes that could impact their students' participation in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Guided by theoretical frameworks from Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), a convenience sample of 14 science and mathematics teachers participated in a series of virtual chats using open-ended questioning and facilitated by two university instructors. Using conversation and critical discourse analyses, three primary themes emerged: understanding of issues related to stereotypes, encouragement of females and minorities to pursue careers in STEM, and the place for diversity discussions in science and mathematics classrooms. The teachers felt burdened by curricular and administrative constraints that inhibit their ability to participate in thought-provoking critical conversations. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways teachers can assist in the STEM career identity development of their underrepresented females and students of color and calls for research that combines the key findings in SCCT and CRT to build confidence and capacity for teachers to effectively confront issues of racism, sexism, and stereotyping in science and mathematics classrooms.

TI Antiracism and the Problems with "Achievement Gaps" in STEM Education
SO CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Inspired by the biology education research community's collective reading of Kendi's How to Be an Antiracist, I draw together recent articles related to "achievement gaps"-a construct identified by Kendi as perpetuating racist ideas. At the same time, I recognize that, for many in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, the notion that achievement gaps exist is evidence of a problem that motivates reform. My hope is that this small collection of recent work can stimulate critical reflection on what we mean by "achievement" in STEM, how we can understand the causes of "gaps," and what we might consider to be productive steps toward racial equity and justice.

   Discuss Race and Racism in a U.S.-Based Equity-Focused STEM Professional

ID COMMUNITIES
AB Against a backdrop of calls for increased access and participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in the United States have emerged as critical access points for Latina/o/x and other Students of Color. Federal grants can become important levers for building institutional capacity for broadening participation in STEM and transforming HSIs toward better serving Students of Color, specifically as it relates to curricula and pedagogy. In this study, we focus on the engineering faculty at an HSI who are participants in a National Science Foundation-funded, equity-focused professional development program. Operationalizing Bonilla-Silva's color-evasive racial ideology framework, we use content analysis techniques to explore how engineering faculty discuss race and racism as part of the professional development experience. First, we find that engineering faculty largely rely on color-evasive racial frameworks (i.e., abstract liberalism, minimization of racism) when describing their motivations for participating in the program. Moreover, we find that engineering faculty responses depict a range of surprise and familiarity when reflecting on issues of race and racism. Finally, regardless of prior exposure to module concepts, at the end of the program, the majority of action projects reflect a recognition of race and racism as important.

AB Research shows student success in advanced-level science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs is connected to future educational and economic opportunities. Yet, Black students have been excluded from participating in rigorous mathematics courses that prepare them to engage in STEM majors and careers. This article reviews research on Black student mathematics participation at the pre-college, post-secondary, and professional levels. Three systemic barriers to Black student participation are limited access, limiting mindsets and beliefs, and lack of support. Eliminating these barriers can result in an increase in Black students' enrollment, persistence, and achievement in advanced mathematics courses. The article provides strategies proven successful in urban contexts to ensure equitable learning environments that maximize the full potential of Black students. Educational leaders must address systemic inequities rooted in racism, purposefully engage Black students in rigorous and extended learning opportunities, and provide them with peer and faculty support.

AB The proportion of Black, Latinx, and American Native individuals annually earning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral degrees in the United States (US) has been enduringly and inequitably low for decades compared to their White peers. Despite the intransigent connection between race and STEM doctoral outcomes, US STEM education policy documents typically fail to identify racism as influencing this racial inequity. This paper presents critical capital theory (CCT)-an integration of critical race theory, forms of capital, and fictive kinship-to give racism full explanatory power within the context of US STEM doctoral outcomes. CCT proposes that access to large and affluent social networks containing supportive individuals who have knowledge of how to successfully navigate institutions of power is currently core to STEM doctoral success. This access reinforces STEM identity and belonging, but has been and continues to be primarily preserved for White students via an ever-evolving system of racism. CCT proposes systems supporting STEM faculty's consistent provision of high-quality mentorship experiences for all their students-coupled with accountability for providing this mentorship-would result in more equitable STEM doctoral outcomes.

AB This forum paper dialogues with Sheron Mark's A bit of both science and economics: a non-traditional STEM identity narrative. In her paper, she discusses the development of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) identity by a young African American male during an informal STEM for Social Justice Program. Here, the discussion focuses on Black masculinities, identity formation, and the role of science educators in making STEM fields a welcoming place for young Black men. Drawing from Mark's data and discussion, this paper is a dialogue between science identity possibilities in the United States and in Brazil when we look at the intersections of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using the shared colonial past of both countries a connection is established to address race relations within science education. The main argument in this paper is that racism can no longer be denied and dismissed by the science education community worldwide and that intersectional approaches are needed to face this issue.

AB This paper explores the current views and experiences of university students towards issues of race and racism in England. A decade into the UK's Equality Act (2010), we have witnessed a proliferation of support for minority rights and movements, especially from the younger generation, often praised as progressive and liberal. Yet, in UK higher education, there is growing evidence and concern about racial and ethnic inequalities in the experiences and outcomes of minority ethnic students. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 42 undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degrees, the authors explore the nuances in racial perspectives as they highlight three contemporary student discourses of racism: the naive; the bystander; and the victim. Implications for policy and practice are suggested.

AB The recent anti-racist movements in the United States have inspired a national call for more research on the experiences of racially marginalized and minoritized students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As researchers focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, we contend that STEM education must, as a discipline, grapple with how analytic approaches may not fully support equity efforts. We discuss how researchers and educational practitioners should more critically approach STEM equity analyses and why modifying our approaches matters for STEM equity goals. Engaging with equity as a process rather than a static goal, we provide a primer of reflective questions to assist researchers with framing, analysis, and interpretation of student-level data frequently used to identify disparities and assess course-level and programmatic interventions. This guidance can inform analyses conducted by campus units such as departments and programs, but also across universities and the scientific community to enhance how we understand and address systemic inequity in STEM fields.

AB Women of color (WOC) continue to be underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where they often experience racism and sexism within disciplinary contexts that have historically privileged men and Whiteness. Participant narratives gained through focus-group and follow-up interviews illuminate the racialized and gendered STEM transfer experiences of 21 WOC who attended 2- and 4-year Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Using a multidimensional intersectional approach, we explore the interplay between the complex identity experiences of WOC and the dynamic intersections of their transfer pathways across 2- and 4-year HSIs and within STEM disciplinary contexts. Findings underscore the inequities that continue to pervade STEM and highlight opportunities for transforming disciplinary and institutional cultures, particularly within HSI STEM transfer pathways, where there is great potential for these diverse institutions to support, validate, and benefit from the unique contributions of WOC.

AB PurposeLocal and national U.S. programs focused on diversifying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in academia and industry have created academic pathways for Black Engineers. However, most STEM diversity programs in doctoral education typically end or availability significantly decreases. This absence leaves little or limited guidance during the challenging process of completing this terminal degree and seeking employment.MethodWe interviewed 43 Black PhD engineering and computing doctoral students, 37 discussed their experiences receiving equity-minded mentorship in a STEM diversity program, and we asked them about the value and lapsing of this programming.ResultsThese doctoral students felt the absence of equity-minded mentoring through culturally affirming diversity programming. Often, funding for these programs has been reduced or eliminated for graduate students. National conferences, sponsored by national societies, partially filled the vacuum, offering equity-minded mentoring that affirmed STEM identities.DiscussionWe propose that doctoral students benefit from institutionally-maintained diversity programs that address racial disparities. These programs could provide mentoring focused on equity and based on a clear comprehension of structural racism in STEM fields. They also offer counter-narratives that challenge the underrepresentation of Black individuals in STEM.

AB Background Repeated calls to diversify the population of students earning undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields have noted the greater diversity of community college students and their potential to thus have an impact on the racial/ethnic composition of 4-year degree earners. In this paper, we investigate barriers and supports to Black women's success in STEM, using longitudinal interview data with seven Black women who were enrolled at community colleges and stated an interest in majoring in STEM at 4-year institutions. Results Our findings highlight a contrast between community colleges and universities. At community colleges, Black women were able to form supportive relationships with professors and peers, downplayed the potential of racism and sexism to derail their STEM ambitions, and saw little to no impact of bias on their educational experiences. Those students who transferred characterized university climates very differently, as they struggled to form supportive relationships and experienced racism and sexism from professors and peers. Conclusions We conclude using Patricia Hill Collins' Domains of Power framework to categorize students' experiences, then end with recommendations for change that will result in less alienating experiences for Black women, among other minoritized students.

AB There is a mountain of evidence demonstrating that students with marginalized, i.e. purposefully socially excluded, identities experience significantly worse academic and social outcomes in STEM disciplines. However, there has been less attention on how white women, who experience sexism due to their gender but are privileged due to their race, simultaneously contribute to and play a role in dismantling systemic racism. In this study, I used constructivist grounded theory to explore the process through which white women in STEM commit to racial justice both within and outside of their disciplines. Interviews with 36 white women in STEM across a range of disciplines helped build an emergent model that illustrated how participants advanced through three stages to move toward actionable anti-racist commitment. However, many participants struggled to connect STEM with their anti-racist practice, as many STEM disciplines lacked anti-racism curriculum and/or the ability to practice anti-racism within STEM. This model helps illustrate the complex process in which white women in STEM become committed to racial justice. Within STEM specifically, this research has direct implications for the importance of adding social contexts and anti-racist material directly into STEM curricula to foster anti-racist practices for future STEM professionals.

AB Undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classrooms are not race-neutral spaces, and instructors have the power to center racial equity and inclusion in their instructional practices. Yet how instructors think about race and racism can impact whether and how they adopt inclusive practices. We examined how 39 undergraduate STEM instructors noticed anti-Black racialized events that were experienced by students in classroom narratives. We created narrative cases that described multiple common, harmful anti-Black racialized experiences based on extant research and guidance from an expert advisory board. Instructors responded to cases by describing the problems they noticed. Using frameworks of racial noticing and color-evasive racial ideology, we conducted qualitative content analysis of instructor responses. Color-evasive racial ideology was pervasive, with most responses (54%) avoiding any discussion of race, and few responses acknowledging race or racism in more than one event (10%). We characterized six forms of color-evasiveness. This study adds to a growing body of literature indicating that color-evasion is pervasive in STEM culture. Instructors would benefit from professional development that specifically aims to counter color-evasiveness and anti-Blackness in teaching. Furthermore, STEM disciplines must pursue systemic change so that our organizations value, expect, promote, and reward the development and enactment of a critical racial consciousness.

AB This mixed-methods study reports the results of a survey completed by a sample of Puerto Rican social and natural scientists (STEM-S) regarding their perceptions of the intersectionalities of racism, colorism, colonialism, and the culture of science. Most participants ranked themselves as light-skinned and were familiar with the racist stereotypes presented in the survey, with female participants reporting hearing racial stereotypes significantly more frequently than males. Dark-skinned Latinx scientists were more likely to experience discriminatory practices in general, in K-12 schools, and at meetings with colleagues or peers. The higher the professional level, the fewer the interactions with coworkers or peers who were darker-skinned. Power differences among lighter and darker-skinned scientists were attributed to systemic and covert racism, discrimination, and the influences of slavery and colonialism. Fostering anti-racist education in K-16 STEM courses, and more Black and Afro-descendant mentors and role models were suggested as ways to challenge racial inequities in STEM-S fields.

TI REVISITING THE COMPLEXITY OF RACIAL UNDERSTANDINGS AND SUBJECTIVE
   EXPERIENCES OF RACE AMONG STUDENTS OF COLOR IN STEM HIGHER EDUCATION
   TOWARD A RACIAL REAPPRAISAL FRAMEWORK
SO JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA English

AB Despite significant investment in expanding post-secondary access and success for racially minoritized populations within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, persistent educational disparities remain. While the literature has importantly identified and described the myriad ways in which students of color experience exclusion within STEM fields on the basis of race (and, perhaps, other social identity statuses), this area of scholarship is not always theoretically grounded in an understanding of racial hierarchies, processes of racialization, or theories of race and racism. That is, despite the abundant literature on students of color in STEM, there is comparatively limited theoretical attention to race itself, which limits conceptual understanding of the complexities associated with navigating and negotiating STEM contexts. For example, an emphasis on the presumed detrimental or beneficial experiences and outcomes associated with racial minority status may oversimplify the complexity of how race and racism are subjectively experienced at the individual level. Specifically, an individual's attempt to understand, navigate, negotiate, or reappraise their racialized status and persist in an inherently stratified, racialized system of educational opportunity is lost when applying essentialist ideas about race, thus reinforcing dichotomous ideas about advantageous or detrimental consequences of racial minority status. To address this, this paper advances a new conceptual model- the racial reappraisal framework-that more fully accounts for the complex cognitive work students of color engage in when they consider and experience racialization and racism.

AB In this manuscript, we discuss how we, four women scholar-practitioners of color (WSPoC), utilize their cultural intuition (CI) to navigate the work place and academia in the context of our professional roles situated within STEM-M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics-Medicine) K-16 setting. We collectively shared our testimonios through platicas in writing group sessions creating a virtual counterspace that allowed us to examine the role of CI in our lives. From that examination, we developed a conceptual model of Scholar-Practitioner Cultural Intuition (SP-CI) consisting of five tenets. The objectives of this manuscript are to describe the testimonio process, the conceptual model that emerged from the analysis of the testimonios, and the model itself. Thus, this manuscript strives to reconstruct and reimagine the understanding of how scholar practitioners (SP) navigate and advocate for themselves and students within racist educational structures and systems.

AB Using critical race structuralism (CRS), a new contribution, as well as primary and secondary data, this article explores the role of science in teaching social justice issues in urban education. In the United States, a teaching workforce, which is predominately White, middle class, and female, intersects with an increasingly diverse student population, creating a need for culturally responsive teaching practices, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) classes. An investigation of existing literature reveals the need for greater emphasis on environmental racism and social justice as they pertain to students living in low-income and urban communities. Our findings reveal that CRS can be utilized in a collective effort to transform teacher education programs and teacher pedagogy, to effectively address environmental racism and other social justice issues in urban schools and communities.

AB International teaching assistants (ITAs) are criticized for having 'unintelligible' accents for professional communication in Global North English-medium universities. Furthermore, this criticism takes a racist form as it is frequently directed at racially minoritized ITAs. This article complicates this narrative by considering how the disciplinary cultures in which ITAs work influence racist perceptions of and expectations about their accents. Drawing on interviews with engineering ITAs in Ontario, Canada, the article details how the communication conventions and gendered racism of engineering made the ITAs' accents professionally inadequate and outlined what they should sound like. This was done through microaggression learning, the informal learning that the ITAs underwent through experiencing microaggressions based on raciolinguistic ideologies and engineering norms. The article concludes by suggesting reforms within engineering to combat the linguistic and gendered racism of the field.

AB Background Race and gender disparities remain a challenge in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether one's race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by STEM students of color. Results The quantitative and qualitative data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other students of color in the sample. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty members, and students to work together to address racism at the campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings reveal the continued presence of anti-Black racism in higher education.

AB In this case study, we present opportunities science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education provided to a sixth-grade class. We collected observational and interview data in a language arts and a science class over 1 year. We used the liberation social psychology (LSP) framework to understand students' discourses and discussions as they drew from science, engineering activities, and language arts ideas. Further, LSP allowed us to explore students' engagement in critical reflection of social, racial, and other discrimination. The data analysis showed that STEAM education promoted the integration of science ideas, engineering design, social and critical consciousness. We found STEAM education supported discourses of critical reflection, racism, and social discrimination in class. Finally, we argue that STEAM education in Asia-Pacific and Global South countries has to be about critical consciousness, social change, and liberation of underrepresented groups and immigrants for more inclusive, sociopolitically conscious, and democratic STEAM education experiences.

TI Is it transformation or reform? The lived experiences of African women
   doctoral students in STEM disciplines in South African universities
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Transformation; Reform; STEM; Intersectionality; Higher education
ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; GENDER; INTERSECTIONALITY; MATHEMATICS
AB Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields have historically been disciplines dominated by white men. The colonial ideology designated Africans as subhuman, inferior intellectually, socially, and culturally to the white masculine norm in STEM disciplines. STEM education and careers were thus constructed to attract white, heterosexual, middle-to-upper class, Christian, able-bodied men. This positioning ensured that STEM environments remained inhospitable to anyone whose identity was outside the constructed somatic norm. The calls and imperatives to transform notwithstanding, the transformation process in STEM disciplines is moving at a snail-like pace. This article argues that what is occurring in STEM disciplines in South African universities is reform not transformation. It is underpinned by the intersectional theory within the qualitative paradigm. Seventy-three African doctoral and postdoctoral women students in STEM were interviewed from five South African universities. The findings highlighted how African women in STEM face challenges based on their racial and gendered identities and that what is presented as transformation is still oppressive to them. The study also found that equity through access to education in democratic South Africa does not equate to transformation. The argument presented is that despite existing policies and initiatives in South African universities to transform, the demographic inclusion of African, female staff and students does not necessarily equate to transforming the STEM environment. What needs to occur is a shift beyond reform and towards transformation through the use of strategic inventions which dismantle the racist, sexist, classist, and xenophobic ideology that permeates these environments.

AB Diversifying the academic workforce requires equitable and inclusive training environments. Essential to achieving this goal is understanding the relevance of racial and cultural identities in our interactions and a willingness and ability to engage in frank discussions about race and racism. Grounded in reflective practice, somatic abolitionism, and social justice education theory, this practice brief articulates six guiding principles for culturally responsive facilitation within diversity, equity, and inclusion workshops for adult learners. We use our collective experience implementing a mentorship education intervention, Culturally Aware Mentoring, with faculty in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine to illustrate these principles.

AB The perceptions of students interested in STEM, particularly those too often excluded due to race and/or gender, are necessary to create educational experiences that additively contribute to students' access and inclusion in STEM. The purpose of this inquiry was to understand the perceptions of 34 high-school students about race and gender representation in STEM. Students participated in a 3-week, university-sponsored summer programme geared toward teaching and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). At the end of the programme, we interviewed students about STEM in their community, STEM role models, potentially working in a STEM field, barriers to STEM, and why they think White men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields. Guided by a critical framework with an intersectional lens, qualitative content analysis of interview data centered on the descriptive codes "race" and "gender" using a constant comparative analytic approach. Results indicated that participants (1) drew on family role models in STEM, (2) used White privilege and patriarchy at varying levels to explain exclusion from STEM, (3) described limited, stereotypical, and hidden depictions of race and gender in STEM, and (4) often perceived STEM as "pushed" while not explicitly associating STEM with helping, or giving back to their community. Implications drawn from participant perspectives call for educational endeavors that expand dominant conceptions of who and what is considered STEM, center students' families and communities, utilize a problem-based approach positioning STEM as a tool for social justice, and include direct conversations about gendered racism and stereotypes.

ID LITERACY
AB This article draws on the concept of race and racism as "technologies of affect" to think with some of the interventions and arguments of critical affect studies. The author suggests that critical affect theories enable the theorization of race and racism as affective modes of being that recognize the historically specific assemblages which are practiced in schools and the society. It is also argued that rethinking race and racism as technologies of affect, a vision of anti-racist politics and practice in education can be formed in ways that go beyond recognition or resistance, but rather attend to the production of pedagogical spaces and practices that create ways of living differently. The education implications of this idea are discussed in relation to how teachers and teacher educators can begin not only to analyze the affective mobilizations of race and racism, but also to engage in political struggles that harness the affective forces of anti-racist action in everyday life.

LA English
DT Article
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MICROAGGRESSIONS; EXPERIENCE; COLLEGE; CLIMATE
AB This article reports on racism expressed by school personnel (administrators and teachers) and experienced by Latina/o students at a high school located in Tucson, Arizona. Students in a specialized social science research program, called the Social Justice Education Project (SJEP), documented personal encounters with racist articulations at their school. After students conducted observations of their own interactions on campus, they would write (weekly) field notes as part of a research assignment to document racism in education. Most verbal exchanges influenced by racism can be categorized into direct racist statements or racial microaggressions. Both of these racist articulations are tantamount to derogatory comments or slurs that attempt to make an individual from a marginalized group feel inferior to or different (in a negative sense) from the dominant group. This article focuses on the SJEP, implemented at one particular Tucson high school, during the 2010-2011 school year. Excerpts from the students' field notes present evidence of racist articulations. The article concludes with recommendations on how to ameliorate the educational experiences of students of color with culturally relevant and responsive policies and practices that will move the discourse on marginalized groups in a positive direction.

AB As an introduction for a special journal volume on Challenging Anti-Black Racism across the Social Work Curriculum, this paper situates the volume's contributions within a larger anti-racist tradition in social work including the often overlooked legacy of the profession's Black leaders. It discusses multiple strands of anti-racist social work scholarship that provide scaffolding to support current and future anti-racist practices and thought. These include the paradigm shift from cultural competence to critical race theory; interpersonal and behavioral science approaches; Afrocentric perspectives; and decolonization theory. The article previews the volume's contributions which both reflect these traditions and move beyond them. We argue that the endemic nature of anti-Black racism in the U.S. demands special attention in the social work curriculum.

AB We conducted a mixed-methods study of matriculation issues for African-Americans in the STEM pipeline. The project compares the experiences of students currently majoring in science (N = 304) with the experiences of those who have succeeded in earning science degrees (N = 307). Participants were surveyed about their pipeline experiences based on theories that are commonly used to explain matriculation issues. The results of the study revealed that although both groups recognized the major role of race in their experiences, the primary factor distinguishing between students and professionals was their sense of Alignment with their respective community and their different experiences with subtle forms of racism (Microaggressions). African-American scientists were far more likely to report a weak sense of belonging to their community and were far more likely to report subtle encounters with racism. By contrast, African-American science students were more likely to feel comfortable with the science community and less likely to report subtle racist encounters. The findings of this study are indicative of the pervasive impact of racial bias and conflict as a gatekeeper in providing access to science careers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB While a strong literature base exists around undergraduate experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), few studies examine how students approach the question of "what's next" after graduation. This study examines the impact of social ties on STEM college seniors' plans to enter the STEM workforce, and how race/ethnicity and gender impact postgraduation planning in STEM. We interviewed a racially diverse sample of 39 STEM college seniors at a predominantly White research institution. Analysis showed that students relied on weak and strong social ties in obtaining job leads and valued diversity in the workplace. Some students of color and women experienced negative social ties (via racism and sexism) during internship experiences, which shaped their thinking around postgraduate opportunities. We discuss implications for equity, as well as recommendations for research and practice.

AB Latine students continue to persist in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields despite the numerous obstacles in place that stifle their academic potential and contributions. Instead of fostering the strengths Latine students possess that help them succeed despite these obstacles, the field of STEM education has traditionally examined these students' experiences and challenges through a deficit lens. Deficit perspectives posit that any existing disparities in educational outcomes in STEM for Latine students are a product of the students' lack of interest in STEM fields, poor academic preparation and/or motivation, among other 'faults.' In this manner, this deficit approach absolves educators, educational institutions, administrators, and researchers from any responsibility in mediating the disparate outcomes and negates the roles that outdated pedagogical practices, structural racism, discrimination and disciplinary bias have in limiting Latine students' success in STEM. These deficit-understandings of these inequities are pervasive in all aspects of STEM education, guiding curricular choices, pedagogical approaches, assessment designs, interventions and even how STEM fields define knowledge and success. To counter these harmful constructions, this article discusses how STEM educators can draw on Latino Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) and Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) epistemologies to foster learning ecologies that draw on Latine students' cultural strengths rather than deficits. To this end, this article introduces LatCrit and CCW frameworks in the context of STEM education, and combines them to propose an asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approach to STEM curriculum design and teaching. It also contributes guiding questions and application examples STEM educators can reference to advance asset-based LatCrit pedagogical approaches that promote justice and equity within STEM classrooms and beyond. Contributing to this underdeveloped line of scholarship in the field of STEM, we apply these critical frames to help educators (re)imagine postsecondary STEM pedagogies and reforms around the wealth of skills, dispositions, and cultural practices that Latine students possess.

AB Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the chemistry classroom is crucial for creating an inclusive learning environment that will have a positive effect on student's learning, success, and hence, retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). As such, a number of DEI approaches have recently been identified to foster awareness and appreciation of DEI into undergraduate chemistry education. However, in addition to creating DEI awareness, studies or educational approaches whereby undergraduate students are being exposed to some basic DEI knowledge are limited. Hence, in this work, three key DEI initiatives were incorporated into a first semester of Organic Chemistry at a primarily undergraduate institution. The first initiative included a weekly 5-10 min DEI video-discussion activity focusing on building awareness and basic knowledge such as DEI terminology, implicit bias, microaggression, gender, and systemic racism in STEM. The profile of several Black scientists as well as women scientists who have changed the world were also highlighted. The second initiative involved the design of five DEI-based extra credit assignments that connected course content (or concepts) with the historical achievements of a diverse set of chemists. Finally, DEI-based bonus questions were incorporated in three term exams as a formal assessment of student's DEI learning throughout the semester. Pre- and post-DEI-related surveys were conducted, and students' feedback about their DEI learning experiences were overall largely positive. Student scores and answers on the DEI-based activities were analyzed, and the results indicated an increase in the awareness and basic knowledge of DEI in STEM education.

AB Research on the attrition of teachers of color suggests that, under certain organizational conditions, they leave teaching at higher rates than other teachers. Additionally, research has identified microaggressions experienced by Black teachers. Building on the literature, we explored how racism and microaggressions may help us understand Black mathematics teachers' attrition. We designed and administered the Black Teachers of Mathematics Perceptions Survey and found that teachers' experiences of microaggressions accounted for most of the variance in our modeling of teachers' thoughts of leaving the profession. These data reveal that anti-Black, racist microaggressions should be addressed as organizational conditions to be mitigated. From a critical quantitative perspective, the data reveal sociocultural and sociopolitical influences that often go unnoticed in large-scale policy work.

AB The framing of characters by mainstream films can affect viewers' perceptions of social groups, their histories, and their contributions. Using critical media analysis, I explore the film Hidden Figures and its portrayal of Katherine Goble Johnson, an African American mathematician employed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during the United States' Civil Rights Movement. First, I rely on womanist methodology to examine the film's portrayal of Katherine's professional experiences and then Black Feminist Thought (BFT) to interpret the film in relationship to the book from which it was adapted, Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race. The themes in Hidden Figures' portrayal of Katherine were as follows: (1) compliance with the sexist and racist norms of the organization (NASA), (2) reliance on narratives of exceptionalism and omission. These themes constitute the major finding, which was that whiteness was expressed through Katherine's academic and innovative, perfection as an ethical and disciplined (work/er), and belonging and leading. Additionally, through omission, the film is a cultural product that reflects whiteness as a cultural norm. Implications of these findings are discussed in connection to the use of critical media analysis to build critical media literacy in the preparation of African American women dis/interested in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

AB This article analyzes the role of STEM initiatives designed by city and corporate elites in a large urban district and outlines an alternative, grassroots vision for (STEM) education and city schools. Within a neoliberal context of gentrification, displacement, disinvestment, and privatization, STEM schools have become strategic components of Chicago's 'portfolio district' that serve the interests of racial capitalism in three ways. First, STEM schools provide a claim to fairness in the midst of racist school closures. Second, STEM high schools are a corporate strategy for racially stratified labor force preparation that restricts curriculum and reifies tracking. Third, curriculum restriction prioritizes corporate interests over students' capacity to shape their communities and the world. The authors draw on the wisdom of Chicago communities who have led resistance against corporate education reform to critique Chicago STEM policy and point to critical mathematics and science education as part of a model for sustainable community schools.

AB In higher education institutions, critical race theory (CRT) is known to be associated with fields that study racial disparities or systemic oppression such as law, education, and ethnic studies. The impression that CRT is unrelated to fields like business or computer science may have led scholars and practitioners from these disciplines to put their focus on elsewhere than on racial inequality and its implication in their research and practice, despite apparent need. To counter such fallacy, this review article-focusing primarily on the US context-discusses CRT literature in fields where its presence is less known which are nevertheless among the major domains of higher education institutions: health sciences, computer science and information technology, sports, business, and religion. By discussing example research of how scholars have utilized CRT in different fields to challenge the race-neutral thinking that often obscures structural racism, this paper exposes racism's ability to alter manifestations and to appear through various shapes and forms within the higher education context. Initial recommendations on how educators may engage in further discussions or actions will also be considered. This paper concludes that racist ideologies are often hidden behind discipline-specific vocabulary or technical language, and it is by tackling the ideologies at work underneath the technicalities can we address the chameleon-like nature of racism more effectively.

AB Black women in graduate school can experience stress due to blatant and subtle acts of gendered racism. However, we do not know how such stressors are navigated over time among those who successfully complete their PhDs. The current study used a Black feminist thought framework and narrative analysis to conduct a longitudinal exploration of how three successful Black women biomedical graduate students make sense of and respond to gendered racism they experienced and the coping strategies they employ as they persist. When interacting with others, the women experienced low expectations and doubts about being legitimate scientists. These experiences contributed to feelings of isolation, impacted their networking opportunities, and dampened their view of the desirability of an academic career postgraduation. Over time, their coping strategies for dealing with negative racial and gendered racial stereotypes and biases shifted from opting to "prove others wrong" or working harder, to leaning on their social networks for camaraderie and advice as well as choosing to not exert energy to form a response. Implications for mentoring and mentoring programs at the graduate level and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programming are discussed.

AB Efforts to diversify and make historically white organizations more inclusive are as varied as they are numerous. Yet, for all their ubiquity in U.S. higher education, few studies have examined them in real time. This case study thus features a two-day meeting where stakeholders were invited to consider how to make science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields not only more diverse but also inclusive. Drawing on observational, documentary, and interview data, we offer three findings. First, we share how facilitators were ill-prepared to define diversity for their project. Second, we share that facilitators and most white participants hesitated and sometimes directly avoided conversations about historical and contemporary exclusion in STEM, especially regarding racism. Third, we show that, while facilitators and most white participants avoided specific conversations about the exclusionary nature of STEM spaces, racially minoritized participants repeatedly requested more concrete conversations. We conclude the paper with several implications for future research and practice for administrators, professors, DEI practitioners, and funders.

AB Does the public expression and performance of shock, distress, anger, frustration and ideological disapproval of particular sorts of politics constitute a form of collective political expression from which individuals can learn about being citizens? When it comes to the expression of feelings of racial and other types of prejudice, has political correctness led to a deepening of entrenched racist beliefs with no channel for discussion? This article engages with such questions through a case study of YouTube responses to "My Tram Experience" a commuter-uploaded mobile-phone video of a racist diatribe on a tram in the UK. Using qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis, it describes how these performed, networked and distributed moments of citizen angst demonstrate a limited but interesting range of civic engagements with and positionings towards racism, immigration, class and nationalism. For one reason or another these are not allowed to occur in other public for a such as the mainstream media or schools. The article argues that these vlogs are both a wide-ranging potentially therapeutic resource for those needing validation for their racist or anti-racist views, or for those who wish to express and garner solidarity for discomfort and pain caused by racism; they are also a significant though currently uncurated resource for citizenship education both formal and informal because of their engagements with technology, social context, emotional context and political rhetoric.

AB Black Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) college students face a number of challenges in higher education contexts, such as racism and discrimination from faculty. Furthermore, systemic minoritization has resulted in a dearth of Black STEM faculty that can help Black STEM students navigate racially hostile academic climates. As a result, Black students may have to rely on non-Black faculty for support and allyship, which is concerning given reports of inappropriate behaviors and common pitfalls perpetrated by aspiring allies. Surprisingly, few studies have examined Black students' perspectives toward faculty allies and appropriate ally behaviors, which limit the effectiveness of aspiring faculty allies. Therefore, this study used semistructured interviews to investigate Black STEM graduate students' perspectives about faculty ally behaviors. Three categories emerged-prepare to be an ally, foster credibility, and practice active allyship. In addition, the three categories informed the preliminary design of the multidimensional axis of allyship development framework, which contributes to how allyship development is conceptualized and offers practical insights for research, Black students, and aspiring faculty allies.

AB International students make up an increasingly large portion of the US student population, especially among graduate students studying the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. This article analyzes the microaggression experiences of 22 international students in graduate STEM programs at predominantly white institutions. International students, often people of color, may be subject to facing discrimination within their universities. Our results break down the different types of microaggressions that 14 of our 22 participants reported experiencing from faculty, peers, and students, both on and off campus. These experiences include individuals insulting a participant's country of origin, doubting their academic ability, threatening them, and otherwise discriminating against them. Each event reported by our participants is classified into a type of microaggression and is further discussed using Critical Race Theory to connect how international students' racialized and their intersectional experiences are connected to the larger societal issues of racism in the US.

AB Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience racialized stress, as structural racism in STEM takes a toll on their sense of belonging and acceptance as intellectually competent in comparison to White and some Asian peers and faculty. Black doctoral students are often told by campus administrators that the source of this racialized stress is impostorism and it is curable. In this article, we employ phenomenological analysis to examine how 54 Black engineering and computing students experience racism marketed as impostor syndrome (syndrome meaning in their heads). Results show that 51 of our study participants understood their experiences as both impostorism and racism, as some realized that racism created the conditions for being racially positioned as an impostor. We problematize impostorism peddled by campus administrators as a cover for racism, once again placing onus on students and claiming they have irrational but curable behaviors, while institutional and individual racism in STEM runs rampant by design.

TI Anti-racism is not an initiative: How professional learning communities
   may advance equity and social-emotional learning in schools
SO THEORY INTO PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID PEDAGOGY; TEACHER; IMPACT
AB There is a sense of urgency among P-12 educators to dismantle systemic school-based racism and radically transform conditions for teaching and learning in ways that advance equity, social justice, and social-emotional learning (SEL). This transformation cannot be achieved through typical top-down, short-term approaches to school improvement or professional development. In this article we explain how, in an urban school district working to bring Digital Literacy and Computer Science (DLCS) to all students, robust professional learning communities (PLCs) have been leveraged to redress racism and led to changes in teacher mind-sets, more equitable classroom practices, and positive social-emotional learning outcomes. We explain how routine school improvement initiatives, such as stand-alone professional development events, fail to address racist beliefs and behaviors, and are inadequate to the task of advancing SEL. We describe the attributes and outcomes of effective PLCs, including the effects that PLC participation may have on teacher capacity to make anti-racist changes to curriculum and instruction, and advance the social, emotional, and academic learning of all students.

AB Global protests and civil unrest in 2020 has renewed the world's interest in addressing injustice due to structural racism and oppression toward Black and Latinx people in all aspects of society, including computing. In this article, we argue that to address and repair the harm created by institutions, policies, and practices that have systematically excluded Black and Latina girls from computer science, an intersectional, transformative justice approach must be taken. Leveraging testimonial authority, we share our past 8 years of experience designing, implementing, and studying Digital Youth Divas, a programmatic and systemic approach to encouraging middle school Black and Latina girls to participate in STEM. Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level.

AB Black fathers and daughters are the least explored relationship within parent-child and STEM research. This article serves as an examination of the literature around their relationships and STEM learning and as a call to action. Intersectionality, as an analytic lens, examines Black fathers' familial and STEM relationships over time and Black women's and girls' (BWG's) interest and competence in STEM, as well as how systemic factors of gendered racism, classism, and oppression impacted BWG's aspirations in STEM, computing, and mathematics fields. Data yielded 29 publications addressing Black fathers and daughters in STEM, their relationships, and BWG's interest and competence in STEM, computing, and mathematics learning. Findings reveal that Black fathers' roles in their daughter's STEM lives helps develop positive representations of themselves and their cultural backgrounds. This acknowledgement produces a new level of understanding of Black fathers and girls' engagement in informal and formal STEM learning environments.

AB The recruitment and retention of Black STEM teachers is a nation-wide challenge for the field of teacher education. In this chapter, we start to unpack the recruitment and retention challenges faced by Vanderbilt's Noyce STEM teacher education program. We share the analysis of lived-experience interviews from two Black teacher candidates who earned their STEM degrees from an HBCU (Fisk University) and then transitioned to a PWI (Vanderbilt University) to earn their master's in education (M.Ed.) degree. The analysis of their lived experiences revealed four themes: (a) the need for more visible partnerships between the HBCU and PWI; (b) the identification of mentors for scholar success; (c) the investigation for understanding Black teacher candidates as role models for their students; and (d) the institutionalized racism that still challenges Black teacher candidates at PWIs. These findings have implications for how programs situated within a PWI might consider the recruitment and retention of Black mathematics and science teachers.

AB Stereotype management is introduced to explain high achievement and resilience among 23 Black mathematics and engineering college students. Characterized as a tactical response to ubiquitous forms of racism and racialized experiences across school and non-school contexts, stereotype management emerged along overlapping paths of racial, gender, and mathematics identity development. Interviews revealed that although stereotype management facilitated success in these domains, the students maintained an intense and perpetual state of awareness that their racial identities and Blackness are undervalued and constantly under assault within mathematics and engineering contexts. With age development and maturity, the students progressed from being preoccupied with attempts to prove stereotypes wrong to adopting more self-defined reasons to achieve. The results suggest that stereotype threat is not deterministic.

AB A growing body of literature has examined the underrepresentation of women of color (WOC) in university engineering programs, but its primary focus has been on the experiences of women students of color. Research on WOC in engineering is usually drawn from all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, which does little to illuminate the nuanced experiences of WOC within engineering culture. We sought a primary emphasis on persistence and perseverance rather than the typical examinations on mentoring, inventions, work-life balance, or the challenges that WOC face in engineering faculty environments. There are few studies on how and why women of color persist in academia in the face of the intersection of racism and sexism. Using intersectionality as a theoretical framework and inductive qualitative analyses of interviews with 56 women of color who identified as Asian, Black, Latina, and/or multiracial, we analyzed the sources of support for their persistence. Asking which collective factors support WOC in general and which are unique to each of the racial/ gender groups, we identified three major themes-persistence is aided by (1) supportive colleagues internal to the department or institution, (2) supportive colleagues external to the institution, and (3) the intersectional considerations of group-specific nuances shared by Black, Latina, and Asian women engineering faculty members. The implications suggest women of color thrive in departments with supportive faculty, proactive leadership, and a commitment to professional development. We outline specific racial group interventions that can be beneficial for Asian, Black, and Latina engineering faculty.

AB For some time, scholars who are guided by critical theories and perspectives have called out how white supremacist ideologies and systemic racism work to (re)produce societal inequities and educational injustices across science learning contexts in the United States. Given the sociopolitical nature of society, schooling, and science education, it is important to address the racist and settled history of scientific disciplines and science education. To this end, we take an antiracist stance on science teaching and learning and seek to disrupt forms of systemic racism in science classrooms. Since teachers do much of the daily work of transforming science education for minoritized learners, we advocate for preparing teachers who understand what it means to engage in antiracist, justice-oriented science teaching. In this article, we share our framework for supporting preservice teachers in understanding, developing, and implementing antiracist teaching dispositions and instructional practices. In alignment with other researchers in teacher education who emphasize the importance of anchoring teacher education practice and research in prominent educational theory, we highlight the theories undergirding our approach to antiracist science teaching. We offer considerations for how researchers and science teacher educators can use this framework to transform science teacher education.

AB Background Calculus instruction is underexamined as a source of racialized and gendered inequity in higher education, despite research that documents minoritized students' marginalizing experiences in undergraduate mathematics classes. This study fills this research gap by investigating mathematics faculty's perceptions of the significance of race and gender to calculus instruction at a large, public, historically white research university. Methods Theories of colorblind racism and dysconsciousness guided a critical discourse analysis of seven undergraduate calculus faculty's perceptions of instructional events. Findings Our analysis revealed two dominant discourses: (i) Race and gender are insignificant social markers in undergraduate calculus; and (ii) Instructional events can be objectively deemed race- and gender-neutral. We illustrate how calculus faculty varyingly engaged these colorblind discourses as well as discourses that challenged such conceptions of instruction. We also highlight how faculty dysconsciousness in reports of instructional practices reflect potential operationalization of dominant discourses that reinforce colorblind racism. Contribution With limited research on faculty perspectives on racial equity in mathematics, our study documents how color-evasive, gender-neutral discourses among mathematics faculty shape orientations to instruction that reinforce the gatekeeping role of calculus in STEM higher education. Implications are provided for race- and gender-conscious undergraduate mathematics instruction and faculty development.

TI Whiteness as Technology of Affect: Implications for Educational Praxis
SO EQUITY & EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; ANTIRACISM
AB This article explores the embodiment and affectivity of whiteness, particularly as it implicates educational praxis and social justice in education, focusing on the following questions: In what ways are affect and whiteness constitutive of each other in race dialogue? How does emotion intersect with racial practices and white privilege, and what are the educational implications of this entanglement? In theorizing whiteness as a technology of affect, the authors hope to capture the mental, emotional, and bodily dimensions of whiteness in the context of racial dialogue. In particular, the authors introduce the idea of "white intellectual alibis," or Whites' attempt to project a non-racist alibi rather than aligning themselves with anti-racism. Finally, the authors discuss how whiteness as a kind of technology of affect has implications for pedagogical efforts to engage in equitable and anti-racist education. It is suggested that unless educational scholars engage with a theoretical analysis of how whiteness is manifest as affective technology in educational praxis, we will fail to appreciate the important implications of this idea for educational theory and praxis.

TI The Long Shadow: A Historical Perspective on Racism in Medical Education
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID LIAISON COMMITTEE; RACE; ASSOCIATION; PHYSICIANS; DIVERSITY
AB To dismantle racism in U.S. medical education, people must understand how the history of Christian Europe, Enlightenment-era racial science, colonization, slavery, and racism shaped modern American medicine. Beginning with the coalescence of Christian European identity and empire, the authors trace European racial reasoning through the racial science of the Enlightenment into the White supremacist and anti-Black ideology behind Europe's global system of racialized colonization and enslavement. The authors then follow this racist ideology as it becomes an organizing principle of Euro-American medicine and examine how it manifests in medical education in the United States today. Within this historical context, the authors expose the histories of violence underlying contemporary terms such as implicit bias and microaggressions. Through this history, they also gain a deeper appreciation of why racism is so prevalent in medical education and how it affects admissions, assessments, faculty and trainee diversity, retention, racial climate, and the physical environment. The authors then recommend 6 historically informed steps for confronting racism in medical education: (1) incorporate the history of racism into medical education and unmask institutional histories of racism, (2) create centralized reporting mechanisms and implement systematic reviews of bias in educational and clinical activities, (3) adopt mastery-based assessment in medical education, (4) embrace holistic review and expand its possibilities in admissions, (5) increase faculty diversity by using holistic review principles in hiring and promotions, and (6) leverage accreditation to combat bias in medical education. These strategies will help academic medicine begin to acknowledge the harms propagated throughout the history of racism in medicine and start taking meaningful steps to address them. Although the authors have focused on racism in this paper, they recognize there are many forms of bias that impact medical education and intersect with racism, each with its particular history, that deserve their own telling and redress.

ID RACIAL BIAS; HEALTH
AB In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the rapid emergence of vaccines, the dual benefits of both science and technology have been lauded, while dominant, deficit-based narratives of vaccine hesitancy and mistrust in science and medicine by the general public, particularly minoritized populations, run rampant. In this paper, we argue for a counternarrative, where instead of erroneously positioning communities of color as the problem, the problem is reframed to consider what the scientific, technological, and science education communities need to do to become more trustworthy and transgress the persistent shortcomings related to racism and injustice. Specifically, in this position paper, we (a) discuss the interactions of science, technology, and society from the perspective of the nature of technology; (b) engage an understanding of how bias, access, and racism operate in and at the intersection of science, technology, and technological systems; (c) discuss implications of these ideas in science education; and finally (d) pose recommendations to counter alienation and racism with an emphasis on a sixth dimension, equitable, social justice criticality, for science-technology education. In conclusion, we make recommendations by centering a more equitable, social justice criticality of science and technology.

AB This study examines the representation of people of color in 10 US general chemistry textbooks published between2016 and 2020. On average, people of color appear every 320 pages of text, while whitefigures are observed every 24 pages. Theaverage percentage of people of color in the textbooks (12%) is well below the percentage in the US general population (40%),college population (46%), and science technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce (33%). Of the images that do includepeople of color, 26% portray explicitly negative stereotypes (e.g., unclean, poor, sick, primitive, unskilled) and only 31% depictSTEM activities. Several textbooks in this study were reported in 2007 to contain racial bias, but no evidence of improvement wasobserved. To understand the persistence of racial bias, biographical information was used to illuminate the values held by the eightscientists that all 10 textbooks have in common. These eight universally prominent scientists include a lifelong supporter andprofiteer of slavery, a trustee of the Human Betterment Foundation (an organization promoting mandatory sterilization for"racebetterment"), an executive board member of the Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene, an anti-Semitic bigamist, and a modernadvocate of eugenics. We posit that general chemistry textbooks reveal two mechanisms by which racial disparity in STEM ispreserved and advanced: (1) through the invisibility and negative stereotyping of people of color and (2) via an oblivious idolatry ofscientists who have promoted racist ideologies

AB Research in mathematics education has clearly evidenced the ways wherein race structures school mathematics experiences of children and youths worldwide. Nevertheless, some countries, particularly in Latin America, position themselves as racial democracies or places where exist peaceful racial relationships and as free from racial conflicts and tensions. In this paper I argue that, in such countries, racism is alive and it is a critical factor in understanding student mathematics experiences and performance at school. I draw upon Bonilla-Silva's notion of racial ideology and its functions to approach racial dynamics within school mathematics. By using ideology critique as a method, I focus on the interchanges between a white-mestizo male teacher and an eight-grader, black female student to interpret and uncover the ideological fabric of discourses and practices within the mathematics classroom aimed to normalize racism. By bringing to light racial discrimination within school mathematics in racial democracies, my study contributes to unveil and understand racism within mathematics education from a global perspective, and to challenge the myth of these mistakenly called racial democracies.

AB The evolution education experiences of students of color represent an emerging area of research, because past inquiries indicate these students have differential outcomes, such as lower evolution acceptance and severe underrepresentation in evolutionary biology. Religion is often an important support for students of color who are navigating a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics culture that privileges White nonreligious students. For instance, religion helps mitigate the negative effects of racism, but religious students are also more likely to experience conflict when learning evolution. In this nation-wide study, we examined the extent to which strong religiosity among students of color can explain their lower evolution acceptance. We surveyed students in 77 college biology courses across 17 states and found that Black/African American students tend to be more religious and less accepting of evolution than any other racial/ethnic identity group and that Hispanic students tend to be slightly more religious and slightly less accepting of evolution than White students. Importantly, we find that religious background is an important factor associated with Black and Hispanic students' lower levels of evolution acceptance. This study suggests that the biology community should become more inclusive of Christian religious students if it wishes to foster inclusive evolution education for Black and Hispanic students.

AB Racialized and gendered imbalances impact tenure-track faculty service workload and ultimately, career advancement for women faculty, especially women of color faculty. This article reports on a 3-year study examining the barriers to career advancement for women/women of color tenure-line Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) faculty at a large public comprehensive minority-serving university. We aimed to understand institutional policies and practices, and compared the perceptions and actions of 3 constituent groups: Deans, STEM faculty, and members of the university tenure and promotion committee. Specifically, we examined tenured and tenure-track STEM faculty perceptions and experiences with institutional service in an effort to understand how these align or diverge among gendered and racial groups and among 3 constituent groups of institutional actors to uncover tensions that arise with formal and informal service policies and activities. Findings are based on a faculty survey conducted to gather descriptive information about the role of service in tenure-line STEM faculty careers and faculty perceptions of their work-load and value of these activities, in-depth interviews with university deans and members of the University Tenure & Promotion Committee (UTPC), and focus groups with STEM tenure-line women faculty. We found 3 institutional and service-related barriers to career advancement: (a) inequitable distribution of service with no reward; (b) devaluing of service by the university; and (c) lack of clarity and consistency about the role of service in the retention, tenure, and promotion (RTP) processes. Further, embedded in these barriers were experiences of gendered and racist stereotypes and inequities shaping and intersecting with the identified barriers. The study suggests institutional changes to make high impact service activities more visible, equitably distributed, and valued in the tenure and promotion process at this large public, comprehensive minority-serving institution.

AB The ratio of Asian American teachers to Asian American students is the most disproportionate of all racial groups, where Asian American students are least likely to have an Asian American teacher. In addition, little research focuses on the experiences of Asian American teachers, particularly in connection with issues of racism. Using AsianCrit, internalized racism, and stereotype management, this study investigates how Asian American male mathematics teachers conceptualize their racial/ethnic and mathematics teacher identities given the prevalence of the Model Minority Myth. Using photovoice interviews, findings indicate that participants experienced internalized racism and engaged in stereotype management by distancing themselves from other Asian Americans, discussing their own difficulties in mathematics, and actively reaching out to form relationships with Black and Latinx students. We recommend supports for Asian American teachers and all teachers of color to build critical consciousness to reduce internalized racism and empower themselves and their students.

AB Teaching and learning are grounded on age-appropriate, credible curricular resources, which can be formal (i.e. textbooks) and informal (i.e. trade-books). As Charles Darwin's ideas galvanized biology and racism, this study examined his historical representation within trade-books (e.g. biography, narrative non-fiction, expository, etc.), textbooks (student editions, teacher editions, etc.), and curricular supplements (teacher-facing assessments and lessons; student-facing tests and tasks) published in United States. Through content analysis, I contrasted historians' understandings of Darwin with history-based trade-books' (n = 111) and biology-oriented texts' (n = 132) depictions of Darwin. Misrepresentations abounded. History-based books concealed Darwin's colonialist past and disregarded-or repeated without qualification and context-the racist ideas within his writing. Biology-based texts largely omitted problematic aspects of Darwin's past. These 20(th)- and 21(st)-century history trade-books and science texts mirrored the patterns of 19(th)-century American social studies textbooks' Lost Cause logic and 20th-century science American textbooks' anti-evolution casuistry. Reviewed texts obscured the racist ideas within Darwin's words, actions, and inactions, through both omission and commission. Concerns are raised about who determines how historical and scientific content are included, detailed, and omitted within curricular resources published in different countries.

AB In this paper, we share an approach to address systemic racism by highlighting a research-practice partnership [RPP] effort between a university and STEM program (I AM STEM) to understand the extent to which centering abolitionist teaching and emancipatory practices in a science methods course supported teacher candidates' virtual microteaching experiences. This study's conceptual framework put research-practice partnership in conversation with abolitionist teaching (Love, 2019) and community cultural wealth to explore access to STEM teaching and learning. We highlight the experiences of four secondary science teacher candidates through an embedded single case study. Data sources included observation field notes, microteaching reflections, semi-structured individual interviews, and lesson plans, which were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory approaches. Findings revealed that the teacher candidates embraced the concept of abolitionist teaching to inform their microteaching experiences by leveraging social justice standards and emancipatory pedagogies. The participants developed science lessons that honored students' cultural capital through critical readings, discussions, and reflections. Furthermore, the RPP between I AM STEM and the partnering university provided supports to contextualize and humanize science learning for Black and Brown children in online learning spaces. To expose and dismantle racism in science education, we must reimagine our science teacher preparation programs and courses. Thus, emancipating STEM education means engaging in the struggle toward humanity and collective healing. Abolitionist teaching within the context of science education does not require another reform effort. To disrupt systemic oppression, we must demand restorative justice and engage in direct transformative action.

AB This article argues that multiculturalism, especially when it is led and controlled by Whites, and in the absence of collective anti-racist struggles, can reproduce the ontologies, epistemologies, and practices of white supremacy. I use a case study of a reenactment of Atlantic black slavery, produced by white teachers to investigate whether multiculturalism can be more than a technology of white supremacy. I conclude that by employing the restored behaviors of slavery, the reenactment failed to add to an interrogation of whiteness and anti-racism. Instead of contributing to the reformation of whiteness and the empowering of Blacks, it reinforced anti-blackness. I end with a discussion of how to teach slavery ethically.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to explore doctoral students' experiences engaging in conversations about the role of race and racism in education during their programs. We conducted focus groups with graduate students in a School of Education at a predominantly White institution in the South. Our findings support the notion that creating space for doctoral students to engage in "race talk" (Pollock, M., 2004, Colormute: Race talk dilemmas in an American high school. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press) during their courses is essential for developing racial literacy, or the ability to critically analyze racial/racist ideologies, norms, and patterns embedded in educational policies and practices. We assert that our participants' varied experiences engaging in race talk (i.e., the relative presence of conversations in certain programs and their limited presence in others) may stem from a variety of factors including disciplinary cultures and faculty values and expectations, as well as professional standards advanced by accrediting bodies and organizations. In light of our findings, we conclude that critical conversations about race should be intentionally integrated into doctoral coursework in education. We suggest that colleges/schools of education should increase their efforts to produce racially literate professionals capable of problematizing the constructions of race and racist practices in educational settings.

AB Scholars across disciplines and throughout PK-20 education have argued that color-blind ideology works to perpetuate racial inequities in education via policies, research, curriculum, instruction, and student-teacher interactions. This study explores an underexamined issue in relation to color-blind ideology in STEM education. Specifically, it examines how a sample of college science faculty members use color-blind framings to make sense of the underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students in their fields. Interviews were conducted with 42 professors (majority tenured/ tenure-track, white, male, and continuing generation to college) in a College of Sciences at a research-intensive, historically white institution in the United States. Thematic analysis showed that while many faculty members implicated systemic racism in their sense making about the underrepresentation of racially minoritized students in STEM, the majority used colorblind frames (abstract liberalism, cultural racism, and minimization of racism) by focusing on individual behaviors and choices, cultural deficits, under-preparation, and poverty. Consistent with the research on color-blind ideology, professors were able to explain racial phenomena without implicating race/racism, which allowed them to absolve themselves from responsibility in addressing racial inequality issues in higher education. Faculty members who made sense of underrepresentation through systemic racism framings tended to recognize that they had a role to play in ameliorating these issues for students of color. These findings have implications for future research and professional development efforts.

TI Hauntings Across the Divide: Transdisciplinary Activism, Dualisms, and
   the Ghosts of Racism in Engineering and Humanities Education
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE MATHEMATICS AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes-an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States-was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood's (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world.

AB Using critical race methodology as a methodological framework, this paper explores how 16 Black men PhD scientists and engineers describe their undergraduate and graduate school choices and how race and racism influenced these processes. Our analysis yielded two descriptive themes focused on counterspaces for Black men in science and engineering (S&E). Implications for higher education researchers and practitioners, and S&E faculty interested in supporting the persistence of Black men pursuing and completing S&E postsecondary degrees are offered within. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the connections between racism, counterspaces, and undergraduate and graduate choices of Black men pursuing S&E.

AB There is a severe shortage of Black scientists in the United States. Amid the recent national movement to dismantle systemic racism and racial injustices, many scientists publicly highlighted the prevalence of racist learning environments in STEM, contributing to the underrepresentation of Black students in STEM fields. Acknowledging this longstanding troubling reality, this article emphasizes the instrumental role of chemistry department chairs in advancing Black student success in chemistry and STEM broadly. Guided by literature on systemic change and equity in higher education as well as our research on the Black student experience and teaching practices in chemistry, this article describes the following five recommendations for actions that chemistry chairs should consider enacting to promote equitymindedness within their departments to advance Black student success: (i) disaggregate data to make publicly visible racial inequities; (ii) offer formal opportunities for Black students to candidly share their perspectives; (iii) conduct systematic assessment of course syllabus; (iv) measure teaching practices; and (v) create chemistry education research positions. The enactment of these recommendations by chemistry chairs provides meaningful opportunities for faculty and staff to critically examine the chemistry learning environment using an equity-minded approach to in turn inform the development of strategic efforts to support the advancement of Black student success.

AB Drawing on racial battle fatigue as theoretical framing and critical race methodology, we offer the counterstories of 16 Black men doctoral scientists and engineers who relied on same race peer support to successfully persist in their science and engineering (S&E) doctoral programs. Our analysis of narratives and interviews yielded three themes that illustrate the men's engagement with Black peers and how racism influences the types of peer relationships they formed in their S&E doctoral programs. Further, we describe three types of same race peer relationships that support Black men as they pursue S&E doctoral degrees. We underscore the salience of racism and recommend expanding research in S&E by: (1) including the lived experiences of Black men scientists and engineers in the scholarly literature, and (2) highlighting the importance of same race peer networks as academic, emotional, and social structures for Black men persisting in S&E. Within, we offer implications for science education, higher education, and S&E researchers interested in creating supportive S&E environments for Black men.

AB A recent push toward addressing antiracism in science reveals a need to integrate discussions of racism, social justice, and equity into undergraduate STEM classes. Toward this end, in Fall 2020, a theme of "Racism is a Public Health Emergency" was incorporated as an overlay for an existing undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. This theme was used throughout the entire semester and involved discussions of racism, social justice, and equity that were directly integrated with the science content of the course. Students enrolled in the class were surveyed at the end of the semester regarding their perceptions of integrating discussions of racism, social justice, and/or equity into chemistry courses. Students indicated that the inclusion of the overlay increased the relevance of the course material, indicated a high level of understanding of the impact of bias and race on the field of biochemistry, and expressed overwhelmingly positive views regarding future inclusion of similar themes of equity and antiracism in chemistry courses. Additionally, student scores and answers on common final exam questions were compared to previous semesters, revealing that the inclusion of this overlay did not negatively impact coverage of biochemistry content.

AB edouglas@ufl.edu In this paper, we describe multiple theories that focus on the production and reproduction of demographic marginalization and that reject deficit paradigms. These theories have developed in disciplinary spaces that focus on first-order theorizing on race. Some have connections to critical race theory (CRT), while others are sociocultural theories; all are theories we have found to be valuable, important, and underused in engineering education. We introduce nine theoretical frameworks: racial and vocational identity development, color-blind racism, funds of knowledge, antideficit achievement, community cultural wealth (CCW), Nepantla, in/authenticity, ruling relations, and racialized organizations and the history of racist ideas. In each framework, we describe how we have understood the theory, how it has been used in the literature, how we have applied it to engineering education research questions and contexts, the struggles we have had in so doing, and further cautions on how it could be misused. We conclude with an overarching set of guiding principles that can support researchers' application of the frameworks in their work and that practitioners engaging in teaching as-research can consider when restructuring their classrooms as antiracist.

TI Role of Professional Societies on Increasing Indigenous Peoples'
   Participation and Leadership in STEMM
SO FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Indigenous; STEMM; professional society; culture; spiritual; barriers
AB Indigenous people are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) in the United States. Most prior research suggests this trend is the result broadly of settler colonialism, and more specifically of cultural differences between students and school/university environments; poor academic preparation in K-12 schools; vague constructs of educational or vocational goals; insufficient financial aid; unwelcoming school and university environments; prejudice and racism; and social isolation. There is also a vast body of published work on the unique epistemologies and knowledge systems held by Indigenous peoples, which are only recently being acknowledged within mainstream STEMM communities. One potential reason for lower participation in STEMM programs and professions by Indigenous people that has generally gone unexplored relates to unique cultural and spiritual factors that could deter Indigenous people from STEMM fields. Our research investigates the range and variation of cultural/spiritual/ethical practical issues that may be affecting Indigenous people's success in STEMM. Our research provides valuable insights for policy and practices within higher education institutions and industry to provide flexible pathways for Indigenous people to reduce or eliminate barriers related to culturally- and spiritually-informed issues. In this paper, we explore how our findings can be used by professional societies to provide leadership to higher education institutions and industry in the area of changing some standard practices to be more inclusive of Indigenous people. An important mode of systemic change in STEMM fields is through professional societies that guide future practices in various STEMM disciplines.</p>

AB This theoretical paper explores how Chinese international students (CISs) in the US are situated through an AsianCrit lens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stemming from Critical Race Theory, AsianCrit addresses the varying historical underpinnings of racism against Asian American communities, which the authors would like to expand into Chinese sojourner populations. Anti -Chinese sentiment is evident in US history through the prohibition of Chinese immigration and violation of civil rights dating back to well over a century. The framework seeks to challenge normative research on CISs that is largely understood through experiences in international education or mental health services. Key areas of AsianCrit: Asianization, intersectionality, transnationalism, storytelling, and social justice are addressed with both contributions and challenges of negotiating AsianCrit for CISs. Reflective recommendations in student support, organizing, and institutional policies are provided to empower student voices and take action towards those continuing to perpetuate racist practices. This paper is written in the hope of contributing to the dissemination of current CIS racialized experiences rooted in historical context.

AB Background/Context: There is a growing body of research that conceptualizes mathematics learning and participation as racialized experiences; that is, learning experiences structured in part by the negative and unjust race relations that are present in U.S. society. However, the role racialized experiences play in the lives of Black elementary education pre-service students from urban contexts, as both students and future teachers of mathematics, is under theorized.
   Theoretical Framework: Using critical race theory's racial micro-aggressions and the development of a mathematics identity, the author explores the mathematics experiences of 13 Black advanced undergraduate students who are elementary education majors. The participants' narratives reflect their experiences as both students of mathematics and future teachers.
   Research Design: A qualitative phenomenological research design was used to explore the prior and current mathematical experiences of the study participants and their future trajectories as teachers of mathematics. Reponses were coded to reveal themes of racialization and the development of the participants' mathematics identities.
   Results: The participants' narratives cited Black male fathers and close male relatives as their first mathematics teachers, the presence of culturally affirming at-home mathematics activities, and detailed aspirations to teach mathematics fearlessly to their own children and future students. Their more recent experiences included academic struggles in mathematics, often stemming from racial stereotyping and non-affirming college mathematics teachers. Their voices suggest that, within the context of learning mathematics, they have generated self-constructions that include racism as part of their shared African American experience in mathematics schooling that have implications for their teaching of mathematics.
   Conclusion/Recommendations: Recommendations include the provision of professional development that targets gaps in mathematics that are the result of inadequate and discriminatory learning opportunities, and culturally sensitive professional development for mathematics college faculty, with differentiated training for mathematics faculty not born in the U.S. In light of the high proportion of Black teachers working in urban schools who face a host of difficulties, this research also supports the continued development of combatting racial micro-aggressions in mathematics education as a decisive tactic to improve the retention of Black elementary education teachers.

AB This paper unearths the improvisational nature of Irish state exigencies and their central contribution to racialisation in and through schooling. The analysis unravels white-Irishness through gender and Traveller membership, in terms of its links to the state's early efforts at intelligibility and associated politics of desirable and viable subject regulation. It is suggested that mutating theocentric, mercantile and liberal equality paradigms attempt to privilege certain subjects as more viable than others in contemporary Ireland through race, but also class, gender and other vectors of power. Three technologies of potential exclusion through inclusionary state discourses are identified for minority ethnic school subjects. These are language support, pop-anti-racist terminology and the politics of school access and school provision. Ultimately it is argued that supporting 'integration' and 'anti-racism' in Irish education might require conceptual and political vigilance of the terms of the 'inclusive state' at all times.

ID LANGUAGE; EDUCATION; STUDENTS
AB Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism, cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we present insights from a scoping review of research in language education and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical research on language in mathematics education that left interplay between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.

AB Prospective teachers must have opportunities in teacher education to critically reflect on race and racism in mathematics education. Engaging preservice teachers in such conversations during methods courses can be challenging. This study uses a scenario specifically designed to encourage preservice teachers to talk about race, including their understanding of race and racism in an authentic mathematics classroom situation and how a teacher might respond to the situation. Findings show that most prospective teachers responded with complacency by completing the assignment without making connections to the historical marginalisation of women of color, while others responded with contempt towards engaging in the activity. Teacher educators need to be prepared for these reactions when they do the work of developing their prospective teachers' critical consciousness.

We discuss the particularities of these contexts but also explore the how in both contexts Blackness and Black people are relegated to the lower rungs of the social order. In offering this comparative analysis, we call for expanded research on race, racism, and mathematics education in global contexts.

AB This paper briefly outlines three initiatives that the University of Toronto (U of T) Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (FASE) has implemented as initial steps as the institution strives to be anti-racist and address Black inclusivity. These initiatives were based within K-12 outreach, race-based data collection and creating opportunities for faculty-wide race-centric dialogue and learning. U of T FASE was compelled to develop and/or enhance such initiatives after an anti-Black racist incident between students was mishandled and criticized by Black student groups. Using critical race theory (CRT) and personal reflection, this paper highlighted several barriers to the implementation and/or success of these initiatives such as time, financial security, perception of institutional policy and/or provincial law, engineering culture and whiteness and/or colour evasiveness. While definitive solutions to these barriers may not be clear, having a designated champion for specific initiatives, addressing discomfort in differentiating race, consistent advocacy to senior administration and the self-empowerment to resource time and effort to such work were identified as key elements to drive initiatives within the context of U of T FASE.

AB Schools, as social systems, may knowingly or unintentionally perpetuate inequities through unchallenged oppressive systems. This paper focuses on mathematics as a subject area in school practices in which inequities seem to be considered normal. Issues of racism and racialization in the discipline of mathematics are predominantly lived through the practice of streaming where students are enrolled in courses of different levels of difficulty. Such practice denies marginalized groups of students the full benefit of rich learning experiences. These issues should be of concern for activists, advocates, and allies as well as individuals and groups who are systematically and directly affected. The purpose of this paper is to make visible issues of racism and racialization in school mathematics to a range of stakeholders that include: school administrators, teachers, students, parents, education advocates, academics, educational researchers, and politicians. The ultimate goal is that the knowledge gained through this call to action will contribute toward eliminating social injustice in all school systems, particularly as it relates to skin colour, country of origin, culture, language, customs, and religion.

AB Since the inception of the mathematics education enterprise, whiteness and antiBlackness are two foundational components, ideological and social constructs. These constructs help to understand how the law, race, class, power, and other forms of oppression operate to establish, maintain, and elevate racism (white supremacy) in and out of the mathematics education enterprise. The article uses critical race theory in mathematics education to examine the enterprise from a historical to contemporary perspective to illustrate how whiteness and antiBlackness have been normalized and used to exclude Blackness. I argue for a liberatory response anchored in African frames to address the atrocities against Black people in and out of mathematics education.

AB Mathematics classrooms are increasingly becoming sites for investigating social (in)justice, but research on teaching mathematics for social justice remains limited to individual case studies. This article reports on a metasynthesis of 35 qualitative reports of social justice mathematics enactments in diverse classroom contexts. Critical race theory serves as a guiding framework for analyzing possibilities and limitations of these enactments to address racial inequities in mathematics education. Findings from this metasynthesis reveal that addressing race in social justice mathematics explorations provided opportunities for centering the voices of people of Color and critiquing liberal views that camouflage subtle forms of racism and involved substantial and authentic mathematical work. Promising practices and implications for future research are identified based on this synthesis.

AB While current science teacher education frameworks designed to support high-quality teaching have the potential to promote equitable science learning, they do not substantively engage with how racism organizes science teaching and learning. In this critical qualitative inquiry grounded in critical race theory and sociopolitical perspectives on teaching and learning, I analyzed the contradictions that emerged in science teaching practices that were both intended to support Student of Color science learning and engaged science-specific colorblind ideologies. The critical race theory analysis demonstrated how science teaching practices such as connecting to students' experiences, creating interests in science, representing scientists as role models, and scaffolding doing science maintain unequal racialized power relations between students and science when historical and contemporary legacies of racism are not directly confronted. I also propose a science teaching practice of "grappling with racism" as a possible transformative solution to disrupt racism in and through science teaching.

AB BackgroundWe present an analysis of interviews with 27 self-identified progressive white-male physics faculty and graduate students discussing race and gender in physics. White cis men dominate most STEM fields and are particularly overrepresented in positions of status and influence (i.e., full professors, chairs, deans, etc.), positioning them as a potentially powerful demographic for enacting systemic reform. Despite their proclaimed outrage at and interest in addressing inequity, they frequently engage in patterns of belief, speech and (in)action that ultimately support the status quo of white male privilege in opposition to their intentions.ResultsThe white male physicists we interviewed used numerous discourses which support racist and sexist norms and position them as powerless to disrupt their own privilege. We present and discuss three overarching themes, seen in our data, demonstrating how highly educated, well-intentioned people of privilege maintain their power and privilege despite their own intentions: (1) denying inequity is physically near them; (2) locating causes of inequity in large societal systems over which they have little influence; and (3) justifying inaction.ConclusionsDespite being progressively minded and highly educated, these men are frequently complicit in racism and sexism. We end with recommendations for helping cis men engage the power they hold to better work with marginalized people to disrupt inequity.

AB Although the community college plays an essential role in educating minoritized students in STEM related fields, it is also a site where the compounding effects of systemic racism in the nation's educational system are abundantly clear. Due in large part to inequitable access to college-preparatory curriculum in secondary schooling, racially minoritized community college students are more likely than their White peers to be placed in developmental (remedial) math coursework, and less likely to complete the developmental requirements. Over the past decade, heightened concern with high rates of non-completion in developmental math has led community colleges to engage in an unprecedented level of reform, restructuring their programs in order to facilitate students' progression into college level math and science courses. However, whether such reforms have improved minoritized students' opportunities to learn remains unclear. In this study, we applied a race-conscious analytical framework in order to explore the messages embedded in curricular artifacts from developmental math courses at a college pursuing reform. Using indicators of equity-mindedness, we examined the extent to which the curricular artifacts embody explicit messages about diversity and cultural inclusiveness, reflect aspects of culturally responsive teaching, or challenge assumptions embedded in the dominant approach to mathematics education (i.e., racial apathy and color blindness). In addition to documenting a lack of equity-mindedness and cultural inclusivity in our sample of cultural artifacts, our analysis offers a set of tools for researching and assessing ongoing developmental math reforms across community colleges.

AB In Canadian mathematics education, dominant colonial narratives highlight an achievement disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in a way that often re-inscribes perceived deficits of Indigenous students, ignores the educational aspirations of Indigenous peoples, and sidelines Indigenous cultural and linguistic representations of knowledge in the classroom. Intentions of Indigenizing curriculum include challenging and reversing racist and colonial ideologies that hinder Indigenous education, providing meaningful alternatives within school cultures that foreground essential aspects of Indigenous education, and supporting the dynamic learning of Indigenous students. In my research described in this article, I used a narrative inquiry to describe how two Cree elementary school teachers shared promising practices of holistic assessments in school mathematics that centered their Cree language, miyo-pimohtewin, and kamskenow.

AB Critical scholars have argued that mathematics education is in danger of becoming increasingly influenced by and aligned with neoliberal and neoconservative market-focused projects. Although this larger argument is powerful, there are often 2 peculiar responses to issues of race and racism within these analyses. These responses are characterized by what I see as an unfortunate backgrounding of these issues in some analyses or a conceptually flawed foregrounding in others. These responses obscure the evidence that, beyond being aligned with the market-oriented goals of these projects, mathematics education has also been aligned with their prevailing racial agendas.

We examined how race-gender intersections of a child (Black boy, Black girl, White boy, and White girl) in a written vignette shape PTs' noticing. Using an intersectional noticing lens, we analyzed PTs' responses with respect to race-gender intersections. The results indicated how racism and sexism can permeate PTs' implicit bias, positionality, and social expectations, which continue to oppress Blacks and girls within mathematics teaching and learning.

AB Many science, technology, engineering, and math degrees require passing an ntroductory physics course. Physics courses often have high failure rates that disproportionately harm students who are historically and continually marginalized by racism, sexism, and classism. We examined the associations between learning assistant (LA) supported courses and equity in nonpassing grades [i.e., drop, fail, or withdrawal (DFW)] in introductory physics courses. The data used in the study came from 2312 students in 41 sections of introductory physics courses at a regional Hispanic serving institution. We developed hierarchical generalized linear models of student DFW rates that accounted for gender, race, first-generation status, and LA-supported instruction. We used a quantitative critical race theory (QuantCrit) perspective focused on the role of hegemonic power structures in perpetuating inequitable student outcomes. Our QuantCrit perspective informed our research questions, methods, and interpretations of findings. The models associated LAs with overall decreases in DFW rates and larger decreases in DFW rates for Black, Indigenous, and people of color than their White peers. While the inequities in DFW rates were lower in LA-supported courses, they were still present.

TI Methodologically disrupting Whiteness: a critical race case for
   visual-elicited focus groups as cultural responsiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH & METHOD IN EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Visual-elicitation methods; focus groups; critical race theory; cultural
   responsiveness; Whiteness
ID EDUCATION; PERCEPTIONS; RACISM
AB In the twenty-first century, visual media are an undeniable component of everyday culture and sensemaking of race, yet when studying racism in education, researchers rarely centre the visual in their methods and analysis. This trend is alarming considering how racialised messages and violence (e.g. the murder of George Floyd) are routinely circulated at unprecedented rates across information technologies including YouTube, Twitter, and Tik Tok. This paper's purpose is therefore twofold: I use critical race theory to critique the underuse of visual methods for the study of race and racism as a methodological trend reaffirming Whiteness in education. I then draw upon Jori N. Hall's culturally responsive focus groups to highlight an exemplar study's use of visual-elicited focus groups as a culturally responsive tool to methodologically disrupt Whiteness' hold on social science enquiry. I conclude by discussing the affordances of this visual methodological innovation for the study of race and racism. Considerations for future use and implications complete this conceptual paper's discussion of methodologically disrupting Whiteness in education research.

AB While there is increased attention to power, privilege, and access in mathematics education, conversations around race and disability are often left out of the conversation. Disability in mathematics continues to be studied with a lens that focuses on behavior, rather than attending to the situated and sociopolitical context in which teaching and learning takes place. This paper specifically calls on the importance of an intersectional analysis of ability and the need for explicit conversation on the interwoven nature of race and disability to uncover exclusionary practices of hyper-labeling, hyper-surveilling, and hyper-punishing for those outside notions of normalcy. Drawing on sociopolitical perspectives informed by Disability Critical Race Theory (DisCrit) and DisCrit Classroom Ecology, I share a framework of DisCrit noticing to consider the interwoven nature of racism and ableism in mathematics classrooms, provide a context to develop preservice teacher DisCrit noticing during mathematics methods, and a case example to highlight implications and transformative possibilities for (re)organizing classrooms through the DisCrit noticing framework.

AB The documentary Picture a Scientist was adapted into a discussion-based laboratory assignment for organic chemistry students in an effort to open conversations about racism and gender-based harassment in STEM. The viewing of the documentary was scaffolded to prepare students to have a meaningful experience and to help manage and support distress from the viewing, if any. Students had different avenues to process their reflections after viewing the documentary, individually and in a group. The stories of the three scientists remind viewers that the lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion has a negative impact on not only their work but also science in general. The students' discussions and reflections underscore the importance of incorporating environmental and social injustice issues into traditional chemistry curriculum and highlight the fundamental work members of the STEM community must engage in moving forward.

AB Over the past decade, the mathematics education research community has incorporated more sociocultural perspectives into its ways of understanding and examining teaching and learning. However, researchers who have a long history of addressing anti-racism and social justice issues in mathematics have moved beyond this sociocultural view to espouse sociopolitical concepts and theories, highlighting identity and power at play. This article highlights some promising conceptual tools from critical theory (including critical race theory/Latcrit theory) and post-structuralism and makes an argument for why taking the sociopolitical turn is important for both researchers and practitioners.

AB Recent attention to issues of systemic and institutional racism have resulted in renewed calls for antiracist teaching and learning in the health sciences. Concurrently, there is an emerging socio-political mobilization to pass legislation that limits the teaching of systemic racism. We argue that teaching and learning about racism in academic health professional curricula often has serious limitations-stagnating in a place of teaching about the social and structural determinants of health, yet emphasizing health education and individual behavioral interventions as solutions to health inequities. We present a framework that explains essential components of antiracist knowledge and action that we argue must be implemented across health sciences curricula. Using this framework, we call on health sciences educators to examine how learners engage with racism as a determinant of health and to make curricular changes that provide opportunities to learn about and engage with antiracist actions.

AB This descriptive qualitative study used racialized organizations (Ray, 2019) as a lens to examine how 27 faculty, administrators, and postdoctoral fellows in STEM departments at two institutions understood the problems that underlie negative racial climate, the strategies they used to improve racial climate, and the alignment between problems and solutions. Participants did not discuss racism and White supremacy as factors that contribute to negative racial climate. Instead, they indicated a weak STEM pipeline, and lack of faculty engagement created negative climate. Because participants did not attend to how racism and White supremacy fostered negative climate, their strategies (e.g., increased recruitment, committees, workshops) left systemic racism intact and (un)intentionally amplified labor for racially minoritized graduate students and faculty champions who often led change efforts with little support. These findings can help move departments away from intervention-centered models of change and toward more systemic approaches that contest how racialized organizations operate.

AB Heterogeneity is fundamental to learning and when leveraged in instruction, can benefit racially minoritized children. However, finding ways to leverage heterogeneity toward disciplinary teaching is a formidable challenge and teachers can benefit from targeted support to recognize heterogeneity in STEM, and its relationship to race and racism in disciplinary teaching. These data draw from a nine-day professional development seminar for secondary teachers to promote heterogeneity in STEM learning (n = 12). Drawing on analyses of lesson plans developed by teachers during the seminar, and subsequent video analyses of small group discussions, we present a case of four teachers debating heterogeneity in science. The exchange is significant because it draws into relief the ideological and emotional terrain of disturbing the racial hierarchy in which Western Modern Science (WMS) is steeped, and its implications for the education of racially minoritized youth. In the focus interaction, a dynamic emerged where three teachers exalted WMS, while the fourth grappled with how cultural heterogeneity has or could matter to her science teaching. Drawing on the constructs of racial-ideological micro-contestation and racial microaggressions, this analysis illustrates three important dimensions to the design of professional learning for STEM teachers that center race: (1) how discipline-specific discussions can uniquely surface the latent racial and ideological meanings teachers associate with STEM; (2) the centrality of teachers' storied knowledge in grappling with heterogeneity; and (3) the interplay of micro-contestation and microaggressions in understanding and anticipating the experiences of minoritized teachers when debating issues of race, disciplinarity, and teaching.

AB Marginalized communities cannot and do not have decontextualized experiences with how socioscientific issues, such as exposure to COVID-19 as frontline essential workers, high Black infant mortality rates, air pollution leading to respiratory problems, and other issues, affect their communities. As PreK-12 science teachers and teacher educators strive to dismantle oppressive practices in their classrooms and curriculum, it would be helpful to learn from Black women science teachers who have been engaging in anti-racist practices before the racial awakenings of Summer 2020. In this study, three different virtual focus groups, or Sista Circles, were conducted with 18 Black women secondary science teachers. Ranging from 1 to 22 years of experience, Black women teachers across the country and international participants in Canada and Qatar participated in the Sista Circles. From intersectional qualitative analysis and narrative inquiry, the findings of the study reveal that Black women science teachers enact anti-racist science teaching by bringing something new to the community; using NGSS standards within the context of the community; teaching at the intersection of history, culture, and science learning and teaching; and building critical consciousness in the science classroom. Furthermore, the findings of the study have implications for the use of anti-racist frameworks within the context of science education that were authentically the practices of the Black women in the study. This study offers insights into how the critical consciousness of Black women teachers can be represented in the science classroom even in times of nonsupport from peers and administration. The power and necessity of Black women teachers are paramount in science classrooms specifically because of the neutral, apolitical ways science teaching has been approached in the past. The narratives and stories shared here exemplify how Black women science teachers transform science teaching and learning by displaying various acts of Criticality.

DE Science and engineering education; Radical care; Relationality;
   Perspective-taking; Climate change
AB Science education and science education research have long taken a lead in educating the public about climate change by arguing that the public needs to understand the scientific models that explain the mechanisms of global warming and predict future impacts. However, as of yet, this focus on understanding climate models has failed to have an impact on motivating a coherent societal response to climate change or the preparation for its consequences. One issue is the prevalence of technocratic, neoliberal, and settler colonial discourses in science and engineering education standards documents that perpetuate colonialism and racism and undermine the potential impact of science literacy as a response to climate change. In her article "Just worlding design principles: Childrens' multispecies and radical care priorities in science and engineeringeducation," Anastasia Sanchez provided a clear vision for how radical care could offer a principal ethic by which to create a more just and caring response to climate change, a defining issue of our time. At its core, radical care is about building relationality. One strategy for fostering relationality is perspective-taking. Nurturing perspective-taking in science and engineering education could build the sense of co-responsibility for each other that is essential for community-based strength and resistance in the face of cultural and ecological disruption and destruction. We indeed live in precarious times, and radical care will be necessary for us to survive.

TI Conceptual and theoretical frameworks for leveraging makerspaces to
   encourage and retain underrepresented populations in STEM through
   learning by design
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

AB Amidst this era of rapid technological advancement, the impact of White dominance in STEM causes inequity throughout the design, implementation, and function of modern technologies. Evidence of this includes AI systems that perpetuate racial and gender biases, medical devices that are incompatible with non-White medical needs, and hiring algorithms that prioritize the White male experience. Though not a panacea, greater representation of traditionally marginalized groups in the STEM workforce will help reduce and safeguard against digital racism, sexism, and ableism. Advocates of greater representation in STEM fields suggest that makerspace pedagogy and design that is rooted in equity and inclusivity can attract students from traditionally marginalized groups and make STEM more accessible and welcoming to all. To this end, this paper proposes a modification of the TPACK theoretical framework (Koehler and Mishra in Contemp Issues Tech Teach Educ 9(1):60-70, 2009) that centers knowledge of technological and inclusive practices in Makerspaces, giving rise to the Maker Technology, Pedagogy, Inclusion, and Content Knowledge (MakerTPICK) theoretical framework. Additionally, this paper presents the Makerspace Planning, Implementation, Establishment, and Reassessment (PIER) conceptual framework. This framework outlines the process for makerspace leaders to create and sustain an inclusive makerspace through the MakerTPICK framework, be they teachers in a school setting or makerspace coordinators outside of the field of K-12 education. The paper describes future implications for these frameworks in terms of practical applications for makerspaces and applied to research settings.

AB The first 1,000 days is one of the most consequential times for children's development. As a hugely ignored adversity embedded in all aspects of black children's lives before birth and throughout their life course, racism in all forms deserves more attention in the developmental science literature. Racism-including structural, institutional, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural-negatively impacts the health, learning, and well-being of black children, their families, and their communities. Using the Integrative Model for the Study of Developmental Competencies for Minority Children and Critical Race Theory frameworks, this article elucidates how racial disparities in every opportunity and outcome connected to black children and their ecosystem are due to white supremacy and anti-black racism. We call for urgent action focused on preservation, protection, and promotion to address white supremacy and combat anti-black racism through racial equity and culturally grounded science and policymaking.

AB Building on previous research that has described the underrepresentation of women of color in science fields, this paper presents case studies of Black middle school girls to examine how their science identities developed over space and time. Data were collected over the course of their seventh-grade year in both in school (science classroom) and out-of-school (afterschool club) contexts. The Multidimensionality of Black Girls' STEM Learning framework was used to explore the role of the afterschool club as a counterspace and how students made sense of science, science people, and their current and future selves based on their experiences in school and after school science contexts. All three participants struggled to see their future selves as scientists and made distinctions amongst being a science person, a person who likes science, or a scientist. They also negotiated views of science as active and hands-on in the afterschool setting while experiencing more passive and decontextualized forms of science in the formal school setting. Implications include a need to disrupt the culture of science and reimagine formal science education by learning from out-of-school time science programs that function as counterspaces to support Black girls' science identity. We conclude that there remains a need to draw attention to and understand the role of race and racism in science education so that Black girls' science identities are affirmed beyond counterspaces.

AB In the past twenty-five years, the number of science education researchers of African descent has grown substantially. With that growth, there has also been an increase in research examining science teaching and learning as it pertains to populations of African descent. The articles presented in this special issue offer a peak into this growing area of work. In the present commentary, we reflect on the articles published here to identify ways that this body of research can be moved forward. Specifically, we suggest that improved theorization of racism would extend our collective work by yielding new research questions, encouraging methodological innovation, and generating new insight into the science education of African people. Drawing from these articles we identify three ideas that can point our attention to the types of questions we should ask as we conduct research with Black participants. The first is that racism is enabled by (and enacted through) images that are held and promulgated about African people. The second is that racism is enabled by (and enacted through) spaces that are hostile towards African people. The third is that racism is enabled by (and enacted through) spaces that are hostile towards African people.

TI A QUEER OF COLOR CHALLENGE TO NEUTRALITY IN UNDERGRADUATE STEM PEDAGOGY

AB Higher education research has documented that racism and cisheteropatriarchy overlap to shape barriers and support opportunities for undergraduate queer and trans* students of color (QTSOC). However, research specific to STEM pedagogical practices (e.g., curricular design, classroom instruction, student support) is missing from this literature, which can provide discipline-specific insights on affirming classroom practices for this population. Reform in undergraduate STEM curriculum and instruction has largely focused on supporting all students, which upholds the guise of neutrality while leaving unchallenged the interlocking functions of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy. As a response to the JWM themed issue's call for reimagining STEM higher education research, this position paper proposes a queer of color research agenda to generate alternative approaches for undergraduate pedagogy that disrupt the violence of neutrality in STEM. Our agenda makes a twofold contribution. First, we extend research on racism and misogyny in undergraduate STEM classrooms by exploring how cisheteropatriarchy informs variation in racially minoritized students'experiences of pedagogical practices when considering minoritized gender and sexual identities. Second, the agenda brings a focus on STEM pedagogy to research on QTSOC, which has been overlooked despite its impact on students' academic persistence and disciplinary identity constructions. The position paper concludes with implications for departmental faculty, college/university leaders, and federal agencies to assist the development of educational practice and policies that disrupt STEM neutrality responsible for marginalization among undergraduate QTSOC.

AB To date, theoretical and conceptual scholarship on anti-racism has been advanced through leading contributions from several disciplines (e.g., sociology, education, psychology). Still, there remain fewer empirical studies on anti-racism constructs, and we know little about the development of anti-racism among diverse youth across key stages of development. In this special section of Child Development, we sought to address this gap by highlighting scholarship in developmental science that attends to the development of anti-racism in children across contexts (e.g., families, schools) and developmental stages (e.g., early childhood through emerging adulthood). In our introduction to the special section, we review the collective contributions of included studies and outline recommendations for future research in the development of anti-racism in youth.

AB In this discussion paper, we highlight a few interesting and important concerns that have been identified in a diverse number of scholars' work. The successive upsurges of racism and sexism in our spaces of coexistence require us to reflect and confront pedagogical challenges which remain deadlocked in the field of science education. We explore instances of how racism and sexism infiltrate spaces in higher education, specifically science education, and how race consciousness and consciousness of sexism can positively influence hierarchical systems and popular mindsets that exist in academia. The roles that "colorblindness" play as a so-called reality in academia are interrogated, as are the unwritten rules of teaching, learning, collaborating, researching, writing and serving one's community. Pedagogical challenges posed to Black science education faculty which encompass characteristics and practices that oftentimes include, for example, experiencing a lack of respect, devaluation, the questioning of scholarly credibility and professional credentials and the authenticity of one's work are examined critically. Finally, we juxtapose the aforementioned experiences, with examples of possibilities that can exist when future and forward thinking about race, racism and sexism takes place in science and science education.

TI The DECAY of Merton's scientific norms and the new academic ethos
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE communism, universalism, disinterestedness and organized scepticism
   (CUDOS); Merton; STEM; scientific ethos; neoliberalism; performativity
ID SCIENCE; UNIVERSALISM
AB This article provides a conceptual reformulation of Merton's scientific ethos widely known by the acronym CUDOS (i.e. communism, universalism, disinterestedness and organised scepticism). While Merton perceived the threat to the autonomy of science as coming from outside the walls of academe, mainly in the form of nationalism and racism, the subsequent rise of neoliberalism and global market forces means that the scientific ethos is being undermined largely from within the university itself, leading to the DECAY (i.e. differentialism, egoism, capitalism and advocacy) of CUDOS. The STEM-ification of the humanities and social sciences academic community has led to the rise of a post-academic ethos. This manifests itself in professional pragmatism with academics facing both ways at the same time by remaining largely committed to Mertonian norms in theory but needing to adapt to the performative demands of DECAY as a new set of institutional norms that prevails in practice.

SO ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER EDUCATION: AN INTRODUCTION FOR THE
   TEACHING PROFESSION
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB After finishing my PhD in applied mathematics, I received a phone call from Professor Tom Cooper and Dr Annette Baturo from Queensland University of Technology (QUT) trying to enlist me into mathematics education projects focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. The first question they asked me (a bit tongue in cheek) was: How can you exist? They qualified by saying that, according to statistics, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are severely underperforming in mathematics but yet you, an Aboriginal man, have a PhD in applied mathematics. How can that be? I was perceived as an anomaly: a glitch in the system.
   My personal experience with education was one of survival. During my education, I was the only Aboriginal student in the class and from an early age had to endure racial taunts from students. During my high school years, these taunts also came from the teachers, which gave additional power and justification to the racist attitudes of students. If I defended myself I was only told to sit down and shut up. During this period I did have a supportive circle of friends, but experiences around race and identity were rarely discussed, and anyway, I was not open to do so. I learnt to be silent; to not make a fuss and to avoid, if possible, any subject that dealt with society, particularly history. These experiences left me vulnerable, with potential to disengage from education; my future and my place in society as an Aboriginal person was not clear.
   I was lucky, and lucky on two fronts. First, I started to excel at mathematics during my high school years, even though I had been an average student in my primary years. Algebra just made sense to me and I could do mathematics better than most of the students in my grade. Second, I had a passion for computers, which were just starting to become part of the education system and available as household items. I would spend most of my spare time in front of a computer creating computer programs for simple games and to solve mathematical problems. These two passions enabled me to hide and become further withdrawn.
   In the mathematics classroom you do not have to deal with notions of race, and behind a computer you do not have to deal with people. As a result, I turned my back on my Aboriginal identity; it had no bearing on my abilities with mathematics and computing. This was not an active choice; it was a means to survive. My passion and ability enabled me to go to university and eventually complete a PhD, but I would not promote my journey as a valid educational pathway. I was not a complete person, and over the years, I still had to deal with what it meant to be an Aboriginal man and a mathematician. This need enabled me to jump at the chance to research in mathematics education and its connection to my people.

AB President Trump's education policies continue to marginalize Black STEM students at the highest levels of education. Responding to a survey on their racialized educational experiences and future career trajectories, an ethnically diverse group of Black STEM doctoral students expressed anxiety about trying to pursue a STEM career during the Trump presidency. Their responses reflected their heightened sense of urgency to be change agents for racial justice in both the STEM arena and the wider society. These survey findings demonstrate that the Trump administration has created anxiety among minoritized people about pursuing STEM careers and triggered an activist spirit in this group of future STEM PhDs. In this paper, I discuss the ways the racist ideologies, practices, and policies of the Trump administration are impairing scientific innovation and increasing activism among Black STEMers. The findings reveal a vital need to continue discussing the consequences of the Trump administration's assault on Blacks in the STEM disciplines.

AB In this chapter, I use figure hiding as a metaphor representing the processes of exclusion and suppression that critical mathematics education (CME) seeks to address. Figure hiding renders identities and modes of thought in mathematics education and mathematics education research invisible. CME has a commitment to addressing figure hiding by making visible what has been obscured and bringing to the center what has been marginalized. While the tentacles of CME research address different analytical domains, much of this work can be connected to the social isms that plague our world (e.g., sexism, racism, heterosexism, colonialism, capitalism, ableism, militarism, nationalism, religious sectarianism). However, the trend in CME research is to address these isms in silos, which does not reflect the compounded forms of oppression that many experience. I review CME studies that employ intersectionality as a way of analyzing the complexities of oppression. Intersectionality's limited use in CME research has been for identity-based analyses. I offer intersectional analysis as a strategy to extend intersectionality's power beyond identity toward more systemic analyses.

AB Undergraduate calculus instruction is a contributor to racialized and gendered trends of STEM persistence and disidentification with mathematics. However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students' perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices - instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) - were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants' perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students' experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked. We conclude with implications for practice and research.

TI Preparing Teachers to Notice Race in Classrooms: Contextualizing the

AB Race-focused teacher education has centered on changing preservice teachers' racial beliefs and attitudes. In this article, we build on this work by exploring how preservice teachers identify and address issues of race and racism in the everyday work of teaching and learning. To conceptualize these processes, we propose the theoretical framework of "racial noticing," which extends the literature on teacher noticing to the consideration of racial phenomena. Using a comparative case study design, this study focuses on three elementary preservice teachers (two identifying as White, one identifying as Black) with antiracist inclinations. Findings show that they demonstrated generally strong competencies with racial noticing during a mathematics methods course, but that contextual factors influenced shifts in racial noticing during student teaching. We argue that race-focused teacher education centered on noticing the impact of race and racism in learning settings can make the practice of antiracist teaching more tractable for preservice teachers.

AB Race and racism are considered standard subject matter in introductory college courses in the social sciences, but remain relatively absent in biological science courses (Donovan, 2015; Morning, 2011). Given a resurgence of biologically deterministic racial science (e.g., Risch et al., 2002; Shiao et al., 2012) and ongoing racial tensions in the United States, it is imperative that biology professors actively engage students in introductory and upper-level courses. This paper presents a tested approach used in an introductory natural science course (for undergraduate, non-science majors) at a mid-sized regional university. A biocultural focus is advocated for teaching about the fallacies (i.e., biological race concept) and realities of race (i.e., racism) (e.g., see Gravlee, 2009; Thompson, 2006). Further, an emphasis is placed on using a visual approach for relaying these complex and sensitive topics.

AB Background: To stem the tide of teacher turnover and prevent shortages, teacher turnover interventions and policies often focus on new and novice teachers because evidence suggests that teacher turnover is particularly high among these teachers. In addition, researchers continue to investigate the root causes of the high teacher turnover observed in many low-income, high-minority schools and whether this is due more to school demographics or poor working conditions. Purpose: This article examines New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) teachers' risk of leaving their first school in their first 9 years. It both describes the patterns in leaving and examines how school demographics and school climate predict these leaving patterns. Participants: The study follows 608 teachers: two cohorts of secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers who entered the classroom in New York City in 2006 or 2007. Research Design: This is a quantitative study of survey and retention data that were collected as part of a longitudinal research project on NYCTF mathematics teachers. Data Analysis: We use an event history analysis (including a life table and hazard function graphs) to describe patterns in teachers' timing of leaving their first school. We also use a discrete time hazard model to estimate the relative relationships between the predictors of interest (school demographics and school climate) and teacher turnover. Results: The findings from this study provide evidence against the general hypothesis in the field that teachers leave their first schools at the highest rate during their first 1 to 3 years. Second, we also found that the turnover of alternatively certified teachers who began in low-income, high-minority urban schools was driven by both student demographics and school climate conditions, including teacher collegiality and student behavior. Third, we found evidence to support our hypothesis that teachers' individual perceptions of their school environment are stronger drivers of their turnover compared with the perceptions of their colleagues. Conclusion: The results from this study add to our understanding about the timing of teacher turnover among secondary mathematics NYCTF teachers, illustrating that teacher turnover may remain higher later in beginning teachers' careers than currently assumed. This suggests that teachers in Years 3 to 5 in their careers may be good targets for supports. Our findings support the theory that improving school climate can help retain teachers but also provide a cautionary tale for a complete focus on school climate; stemming teacher turnover may require addressing larger economic forces (e.g., the global trend toward temporary work) and more insidious social forces, such as structural racism and inequality.

AB As in many countries, for decades in Aotearoa (New Zealand), we have heard the story of the Pacific and Maori achievement gap in mathematics. This has become a widely accepted part of beliefs constructed across multiple communities about students and schools and who can do and learn mathematics successfully. A common response by policy makers and educators alike is to fix the problem of those deemed academically bleak by putting in place a range of interventions. In this article, we challenge the positioning of Pacific students as a problem to be fixed and instead focus on how we can address the practices inherent in historical forms of institutionalised racism related to colonisation. We use an Indigenous research model-Tivaevae-to develop an exemplary case study of the teachers and students from one low socio-economic urban school as they were involved in conscientisation and the reconstitution of educational practices to privilege indigenous knowledge systems. The findings highlight one model of how teachers and students can change institutionalised Western world practices in the mathematics classroom. We argue that the shift to honouring indigenous knowledge systems and a strength-based approach provided opportunities for Pacific students to learn mathematics in ways that supported them to build strong mathematical dispositions, and rather than being assimilated, retain their cultural identity.

AB This paper examines historical and contemporary racializations of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system. The prevailing perception of Asian(Americans) as model minorities masks how their multiple and contradictory positionings in the STEM system perpetuate the neoliberal racial project and reproduce systems of racism and oppression. Through a multidisciplinary analysis of STEM education and industry, we demonstrate that the shifting racialization of Asian(Americans) secures advantages for White Americans by promoting meritocracy and producerism and justifies White supremacy. By serving these functions, the racialization of Asian(Americans) within the STEM system is central to the neoliberal racial project. This paper also suggests how STEM education researchers can reveal and resist, rather than veil and support, the neoliberal racial project in STEM.

AB There is a critical need to disrupt the systemic racism that underlies educational inequities and support greater social justice (Croom, Journal of Literacy Research 52:530-552, 2020). One powerful way to do so is to foster racial literacy (i.e., the skill and practice of critically examining race and racism in teaching and in students' learning [Sealey-Ruiz, Y. (2021). Racial literacy: A policy research brief. National Council of Teachers of English. Retrieved from ]). While building racial literacy is important across development, it is particularly important for young children. This is because children's earliest experiences help shape their constructions of race (e.g., Bar-Haim et al., Psychological Science 17:159-163, 2006) and children as young as three are negatively impacted by racialized views (e.g., Dunham et al., Psychological Science 24:860-868, 2013). Although educators have made shifts to integrate multicultural and social justice content, most tend to avoid and/or experience discomfort talking about race and racism, thereby reinforcing many students' inaccurate or shallow views of race and racism (e.g., "Racism is a thing of the past."). To help early childhood teachers foster racial literacy, we first examine the current educational context with respect to race. Then, we discuss important considerations related to racial literacy in early childhood. Finally, we share practical actions and resources teachers can draw from to nurture racial literacy for themselves and their students.

ID MULTICULTURALISM
AB This paper reports a case study on Maneesha Rai, a Nepalese girl living in Hong Kong and an out of school student. Based on in-depth interviews, a case was constructed of her previous school days and current out of school days. These provided a vivid picture of her life and several themes were created using schema analysis that help explain the reasons for her dropping out of school after Form Five. It has been common to attribute school failure for ethnic minority students in Hong Kong to problems with Chinese language education. Yet Maneesha's case study shows that her experience of failure in other subjects such as Mathematics and Science contributed to her lack of successful schooling. Maneesha's school failure was more than simply a consequence of academic failure. Rather, there were many other interrelated factors such as peer and community factors, dropout history in the family, racism, differences in schooling culture found that contributed to her school failure. In addition, Maneesha, like many of her ethnic minority friends, enjoyed the freedom afforded her in Hong Kong, but it seemed such freedom also meant inadequate attention from her teachers.

AB Critical race theory (CRT) was used to frame a study of the impact of racial resegregation on students in a public school district. Racism operated in the district at multiple ontological levels - such as interpersonal microaggressions, structural economic arrangements, and discursive processes. CRT provided a rationale for the interdisciplinary approach required to track these different manifestations of racism, while maintaining an emphasis on the material reality of racism. Having its origins in the field of law, however, CRT provided limited guidance for methodological decisions often required in a social scientific study. The author found posthumanist philosophy of science offered guidance for these decisions in a manner that complemented the philosophical and political commitments of CRT. This essay reflects on the advantages this combination of theories offers for the analysis of institutionalized racism. Illustrations are drawn from the study on school resegregation.

AB Black queer undergraduates experience invisibility at the juncture of anti-Black racism and cisheteropatriarchy in their campus environments. With the absence of research on queer students of color in undergraduate STEM, it has been unexplored how Black queer invisibility is reinforced and disrupted in uniquely racialized and cisheteronormative STEM spaces. Drawing on Black queer studies and a proposed framework of STEM education as a White, cisheteropatriarchal space, our study addresses this research gap by exploring four Black queer students' experiences of oppression and agency in navigating invisibility as STEM majors. A counter-storytelling analysis reveals how curricular erasure and within-group peer tensions shaped variation in undergraduate Black queer students' STEM experiences of invisibility. Findings inform implications for education research, practice, and policy.

AB This paper presents the Educational Technology Social Justice Matrix based on a review of thirty-eight recent papers from a search for the terms "educational technology" and "social justice." The papers were reviewed using the SJPACK Model (Dyches & Boyd, 2017) for social justice in education, and educational technology themes were generated from the reviewed papers. The Educational Technology Social Justice Matrix presents ways that the field of educational technology intersects with the SJPACK Model. This provides a powerful lens for educational technology researchers to explore and expand their use of social justice to promote activism and anti-racist education.

AB Background: Black engineering graduate students represent a critical and understudied population in engineering education. Gaining an understanding of the lived experiences of Black engineering graduate students while they are simultaneously weathering two pandemics, COVID-19 and systemic racism, is of paramount importance.Purpose/Hypothesis: Black engineering graduate students hold a unique duality, as both Black people in the United States and Black graduate students in US engineering programs that espouse white supremacist ideals. Their real-world experiences necessitate understanding, and this paper highlights the related impact on the students themselves, their adaptations to the pandemics, and how those adaptations relate to and affect their support needs and navigation of their engineering academic environments.Design/Method: An interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach was combined with community-based participatory action research and was situated in Boykin's Triple Quandary. A family check-in was conducted with 10 Black engineering graduate students enrolled in doctoral programs across the country to delve deep into their lived experience as a cultural community.Results: Findings include an emergent framework of Black engineering graduate student values in response to the pandemics. These values aligned with the Black Cultural Ethos, demonstrating an adoption of collectivistic cultural values in times of crises. Further, COVID-19 and systemic racism differentially impacted Black engineering graduate students and, thus, the manifestations of their values.Conclusion: For institutions to be able to effectively support their Black engineering graduate students, they must gain awareness of the students' experiences, values, and needs, in general, and amid crises specifically. The findings presented here provide a critical window into this information.

TI Whiteliness and institutional racism: hiding behind (un) conscious bias
SO ETHICS AND EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Unconscious bias; epistemologies of ignorance; decolonising;
   'post-racial'; racism; white fragility
AB Unconscious bias happens by our brains making incredibly quick judgements and assessments without us realising. Biases are influenced by background, cultural environment and experiences and we may not be aware of these views and opinions, or of their full impact and implications. This article opposes this point of view by arguing that bias is not unconscious but is (un) conscious and linked to Charles Mills' 'Racial Contract' and its 'epistemologies of ignorance'. These epistemologies emerge from what the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU) calls 'our background, cultural environment and personal experience'. Asserting that racism stems from 'unconscious bias' diminishes white supremacy and maintains white innocence as a 'will to forget' institutional racism. In equality and diversity training 'unconscious bias' has become a performative act to move beyond racism through training to participate in a constructed 'post-racial' reality. The article argues that through decolonizing 'unconscious bias', 'white fragility' and 'self-forgiveness' we can begin to see hidden institutional whiteliness at the base of (un) conscious bias.

AB We evaluated the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism on Underrepresented Minority (URM) students pursuing higher education in the STEM fields. Given the ongoing pandemic and the wave of protests in response to a series of police brutalities and systemic racism, URM students were thrown into uncharted territory. We reached out to a group of Black and Latino students who were already engaged in STEM. We began surveys and interviews by asking participants how they were and how their family and communities were doing. Next, participants answered questions about academic progress, challenges, and what support would be helpful. Our framework was based on a mixed-methods approach that draws on the work of Michael Patton (Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice, 2014) and Veronica Thomas (American Journal of Evaluation, 2016, 38 (1), 7-28). Qualitative data from interviews were collected to capture perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of the study participants. Survey data were collected to reach as many students as possible and to provide numerical self-assessments of student experience, progression, and obstacles. All qualitative data were coded thematically using Atlas. ti, with the goal of illuminating emerging themes, and quantitative data were reviewed using descriptive statistics. Themes emerging from both data sets were compared, contrasted, and integrated in order to develop consistent findings that would enhance URM student perseverance and persistence in the face of confounding adversities. This study shows that ILSAMP COVID-19 Study participants maintained a commitment to pursuing a career in STEM. The findings of this study also indicate that the participants are stressed by their immediate circumstances and by the ongoing racism of U.S. society. These students ask for additional financial, academic, and networking support during the disruptions caused by the pandemic. More specifically, students request continued advising and connection with STEM professionals who can help them envision and enact a pathway to their own careers in STEM during this tumultuous period. The study validates the importance of key elements of the national LSAMP model as reported by Clewell et al. (Revitalizing the Nation's Talent Pool in STEM, 2006). These are: academic integration, social integration, and professional integration. In addition, it identifies several other factors that are key to student success, including interventions that directly address racial trauma and economic hardship.

AB The biographical stories of scientists and engineers, particularly those from historically excluded groups, have been integrated into the curriculum for a materials science course. The goal is to help students connect and relate to the scientific content, while opening the door to conversations about social justice in the virtual classroom. We have covered scientists including James Parsons, Hiroshi Amano, Evelyn Roberts, Wallace Carothers, Walter Hardenberg, and Max Liboiron. Furthermore, the technical information covered in the course has been contextualized by facilitating discussions on the history of certain raw material extraction and its ties to racism, colonialism, and the atrocities that result from these practices. This course was tailored to operate in an online setting by telling the stories of these scientists during lecture, and then asking students to express their learning through informal discussions and written reflections. This methodology encouraged conversations about inclusion and the role scientists must play as they consider both their work and the world around them, and students reported higher engagement and understanding between the technical science and the stories.

DE Dysconscious racism; Sociopolitical consciousness; Culturally relevant
   Pedagogy; Professional development
AB This paper is a result of the reflection on Kristin Searle, Colby Tofel-Grehl, Andrea Hawkman, Mario Suarez, and Beth MacDonald's paper, "Whiteness at work in the elementary classroom: a case study," which follows a White male teacher as he is trained to employ an integrated technology unit that connects science, social studies, and language arts. The need for teachers to integrate content in culturally relevant ways is imperative as schools become increasingly diverse. Our engagement with this paper left us to question whether the professional development program was designed to support Mr. Anderson's (and other teachers') sociopolitical consciousness and subsequently his (and their) capacity to enact Culturally Relevant Pedagogy. In this forum, we offer grappling with racism as a foundational practice for teacher education as a way to interrupt dysconsciousness among science education researchers and teacher educators, as well as those with whom we learn.

AB Disenfranchisement of indigenous Pacific voices from STEM limits self-determination and the development of Pacific-led solutions to regional challenges. To counteract this trend, Chaminade University's Inclusive Excellence program delivers culturally-sustaining STEM education focused on sense of belonging and family/community engagement. It seeks to authentically enculturate curriculum, pedagogy, and practice to privilege and separate Western and indigenous epistemologies and to provide deeply immersive nonacademic support. This chapter discusses the imperatives for sustained, system-wide commitment to culture-based STEM education, theoretical and cultural frameworks guiding this paradigm, examples of IE program processes and practices, and a review of outcomes. Finally, next level challenges are considered: student experiences in structurally racist systems beyond the Pacific support bubble, tensions between providing opportunity and perpetuation of regional talent drains, and the implications of asking young scientists to balance cultural and professional identities.

ID RACISM
AB The deaths of black men and women while in police custody, rising anti-immigrant sentiment and rhetoric in high-income countries, and the continued health disparities experienced by Indigenous communities globally have brought race and racism to the forefront of public discourse in recent years. In a context where academic health science centres are increasingly called to be "socially accountable," ignoring the larger social context of race and racism is something that medical education institutions can little afford to do. However, many such institutions have largely remained silent on the issue of race and racism, both within and outside of healthcare. Most medical education continues to emphasize a primarily biological understanding of race. We argue that a different approach is needed. Highlighting the social construction of race is an essential starting point for educators and trainees to tackle racialized health disparities in our clinics and to challenge racism in our classrooms, educational and research institutions, and communities.

TI Enhancing School Mathematics Culturally: A Path of Reconciliation
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE MATHEMATICS AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DECOLONIZING SCIENCE-EDUCATION; INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; RELEVANT; WESTERN
AB Culturally responsive or place-based school mathematics that focuses on Indigenous students has an established presence in the research literature. This culture-based innovation represents a historical shift from conventional approaches to mathematics education. Moreover, it has demonstratively advanced the academic achievement for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students.
   Its success has exposed deep fault lines in conventional school mathematics. Many mathematics educators unknowingly embrace problematic, taken-forgranted notions about their school subject that inhibit student engagement and contribute to Indigenous students'lowgraduation rates. However, innovative researchers and teachers have adapted or developed culture-based teaching materials and strategies that significantly reduce the problems inherent in conventional school mathematics. As a result, these innovators' actions challenge standard curricula and instruction.
   These changes coincide with another profound transformation taking place in countries with Indigenous citizens. In response to having kidnapped Indigenous children and held them in residential schools in an attempt to rid them of their Indigenous self-identities, Canada's federal government apologized in 2008 and established a process of reconciliation (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2016) for all Canadians.
   Accordingly, this article has two main goals: to (a) illustrate how critical analysis can help educators decide which taken-for-granted notions about school mathematics should continue to be embraced and which ones should be updated because they interfere with the engagement and achievement of most Indigenous students and a majority of non-Indigenous students and (b) identify concrete ways in which mathematics educators, researchers, and curriculum writers can help enhance school mathematics by drawing upon how mathematics is used in bothmainstream and Indigenous cultures and in a way that simultaneously promotes both academic achievement and reconciliation. These goals lead to the following questions answered in this article:
   1. What conventional taken-for-granted notions impede student achievement?
   2. Which of these conventional notions continue to be held by many innovators who have enhanced school mathematics culturally?
   3. Which innovative taken-for-granted notions improve student academic achievement?
   4. Exactly how do researchers or teachers "see" school mathematics content "embedded" in an Indigenous artisan handwork or activity?
   5. Which notions found in conventional school mathematics continue to serve students' interests?
   6. How can mathematics curricula mitigate systemic racism and support reconciliation?
   7. What specific actions can mathematics teachers, researchers, teacher educators, and curriculum writers take to regenerate what is essentially a Victorian-era, 19th-century elitist curriculum (for Grades 5 and higher) to a 21st-century curriculum in harmony with today's realities?
   The article advances a pluralist mathematics perspective that makes explicit the cultural nature of school mathematics within an Indigenous cross-cultural framework of respect and collaboration. Mathematics'cultural nature becomes both a context of instruction and content expressed in a curriculum.

AB Engineering lacks quantitative measures of racism and sexism in engineering graduate education. Racial and gendered disparities in participation, persistence, and experience combined with qualitative evidence indicate that discrimination interferes with marginalized students' well-being and degree completion. The Discrimination in Engineering Graduate Education (DEGrE) scale helps researchers identify environmental gender and race/ethnicity-based discrimination in engineering graduate education. The scale development and initial assessments reported here demonstrate the validity, internal reliability, and utility of the DEGrE subscales. The DEGrE scale will assist engineering colleges and departments evaluate their graduate students' experiences to guide decision makers in identifying changes needed in their graduate programs to improve equity and inclusion of marginalized students.

AB The author poses racialized questions and issues about the science of reading to address and disrupt implicit and overt racist practices in producing and disseminating knowledge. Roles, complexities, nuances, and challenges related to racial identity, special education lenses, and motivation are explored to reimagine how we conceptualize, construct, and build knowledge about the science of reading. Drawing from critical theories in education, the multicultural education movement, and a developing conceptual framework that the author calls disruptive movement to advance a racial justice agenda in the science of reading, the author questions who builds knowledge, what counts as knowledge, and why knowledge is constructed in the science of reading.

TI SOME THOUGHTS ON PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO LEARNING
SO INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON SOCIAL JUSTICE IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
SE Montana Mathematics Enthusiast Monograph Series in Mathematics Education
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB The education community knows that improvements can and must be made for the mathematics education of underrepresented groups. Native American schools, in particular, have struggled due to colonialism, racism, and the mistaken notion of members of the dominant society that Native people wish to be assimilated. In fact, sovereignty is a huge issue for Native people across the country; it is an especially sore point in our State, where a 1981 land claims settlement act clouded rather than clarified Native sovereignty. Mathematics education has learned a tremendous amount through the pioneering academic work done in ethnomathematics. We also know that so many others are doing the good work daily, impacting children's lives, but never receive recognition beyond the walls of their classrooms. We are learning about the positive difference of a Culturally Appropriate Curriculum and finally, we are learning how to respect Native America. This is a preliminary paper that intends to open a discussion on the challenge of passive resistance to education in a Native American school in the eastern United States.

AB The purpose of this qualitative research study is to examine the doctoral experiences of successful Black women enrolled in U.S. engineering and computing programs. Specifically, this manuscript analyzes Black women's perceived expectations regarding what they believed their doctoral programs would be like prior to their enrollment in graduate school versus their actual experiences as doctoral students (n = 37). Findings conclude that Black women expected their coursework would either be academically rigorous or not very difficult at all, and that their faculty advisors would provide them with tailored academic and social support. In addition, some of the Black women also expected that they would not have to deal with racism and sexism under the assumption that their respective departments were inclusive and equitable. Black women's actual experiences consisted of unsupportive faculty, surprising levels of racism and sexism, and an obligation to code-switch. This article also discusses the implications of the findings, and strategies for helping Black women succeed in engineering and computing doctoral programs are also discussed.

AB Guided by a combination of LatCrit and intersectionality this study examined the challenges Latina Multilingual Learners' (ML) experienced in STEM and how their multiple marginalized identities (i.e. being Latina, female, and non-native English-speaker) and the oppression related to class, gender, race, and ethnicity influence their perspectives. Using an interpretive phenomenological design, we interviewed 10 Latina ML students from four universities. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis yielded multiple major challenges in navigating through their undergraduate STEM programs: (a) academic challenges, (b) doubts and lack of confidence, (c) discriminations and biases against Latinas. Also, we discussed how system racism and intersectionality of multiple marginalized identity of Latina ML (i.e. class, gender, race, ethnicity and language) influence and interact with their experiences in STEM.

   Medical Education and Health Sciences Research: REPAIR Project Steering

LA English
DT Article
AB Amidst ongoing efforts to address racial injustice, U.S. medical institutions are grappling with the structural roots of anti-Black racism. The REPAIR (REParations and Anti-Institutional Racism) Project is a 3-year strategic initiative at the University of California, San Francisco aiming to address anti-Black racism and augment the presence and voices of people of color in science, medicine, and health care. The REPAIR Project was designed in response to an unmet need for critical dialogue, cross-disciplinary research, and curriculum development addressing structural racism. It offers a framework for thinking and acting to achieve repair in relation to racial injustice and is anchored by 3 concepts-reparations, abolition, and decolonization-which have been deployed as annual themes in academic years 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023, respectively.
   The theme of medical reparations builds on the longstanding call for slavery reparations and the paying of debts owed to Black Americans for the harms of slavery. The REPAIR Project focuses on the specific debts owed to Black Americans for racial harm in health care settings. The theme of medical abolition examines the intersections of incarceration, policing, and surveillance in health care and the role of clinicians in furthering or stopping oppressive practices that bind patterns of Black incarceration to health and health care. The theme of decolonizing the health sciences targets "othering " practices entrenched in scientific methodologies that have arisen from colonial-era beliefs and practices around imperialism, including how the colonial-era concept of race contributes to ongoing racial harm.
   In this article, the authors describe the REPAIR Project, preliminary outcomes from its first year, and potential future lines of inquiry for medical educators and health sciences researchers. The authors argue that the full damage from slavery and its legacies cannot be undone, but everyone can work in new ways that reduce or eliminate harm.

AB At some point most Black and Latino/a college studentseven long-term high achieversquestion their own abilities because of multiple forms of racial bias. The 38 high-achieving Black and Latino/a STEM study participants, who attended institutions with racially hostile academic spaces, deployed an arsenal of strategies (e.g., stereotype management) to deflect stereotyping and other racial assaults (e.g., racial microaggressions), which are particularly prevalent in STEM fields. These students rely heavily on coping strategies that alter their authentic racial identities but create internal turmoil. Institutions of higher education, including minority-serving schools, need to examine institutional racism and other structural barriers that damage the racial identities of Black and Latino/a students in STEM and cause lasting psychological strain.

AB Wetekia kia rere is an expression in the Mori language that refers to unleashing potential. This paper discusses questions of power relevant to challenges recently identified by government officials regarding learners' experiences of science education in New Zealand schools. We begin by summarising the Treaty relationship (Treaty of Waitangi, considered to be the country's founding document first signed in 1840) that informs the framing of New Zealand's science curriculum guidelines. Next we outline some official New Zealand education strategies along with several policy guidelines relevant to the aspirations of Mori communities for a transformative science curriculum. This is followed by a discussion of how the historical processes of ecological imperialism, environmental racism and institutional racism have combined to attenuate Mori experiences of science education. A review of international literature is then presented to support calls for the development of place-conscious approaches to science education which validate Mori knowledge and learning contexts and Mori initiatives to seek eco-justice. Finally, a case study of a P Wnanga (Mori learning community) is provided to suggest potential solutions to some of the problems discussed previously.

AB Existent research indicates that postsecondary Black faculty members, who are sorely underrepresented in the academy especially in STEM fields, assume essential roles; chief among these roles is diversifying higher education. Their recruitment and retention become more challenging in light of research findings on work life for postsecondary faculty. Research has shown that postsecondary faculty members in general have become increasingly stressed and job satisfaction has declined with dissatisfaction with endeavors and work overload cited as major stressors. In addition to the stresses managed by higher education faculty at large, Black faculty must navigate diversity-related challenges. Illuminating and understanding their experiences can be instrumental in lessening stress and job dissatisfaction, outcomes that facilitate recruitment and retention. This study featured the experiences and perceptions of Black faculty in science education. This study, framed by critical race theory, examines two questions: What characterizes the work life of some Black faculty members who teach, research, and serve in science education? How are race and racism present in the experiences of these postsecondary Black faculty members? A phenomenological approach to the study situates the experiences of the Black participants as valid phenomena worthy of investigation, illuminates their experiences, and seeks to retain the authenticity of their voices.

AB Decades of research has documented the consequences of allocating school students into a hierarchy of classes with narrow ranges of mathematics attainment, a process known as streaming, tracking, setting, or "ability" grouping. The purported benefits of streaming are inconsistent and disputed, but the harms are clear, in particular, (1) the limiting curriculum often available in low streams and (2) the loss of self-confidence that results from being positioned in a low stream. Building on this foundation, we discuss streaming in mathematics as tied to systemic racism in Aotearoa New Zealand, where the harmful effects of streaming fall most heavily on Maori and Pasifika students. Previous analyses of race and streaming have focused primarily on the racial composition of streamed classes, bias in stream allocation, and racialised teacher expectations in streamed settings. In contrast, we focus on the emotional consequences of streaming, arguing that streaming produces racialised emotions of shame and entitlement as unintended but predictable consequences. We illustrate the racialised production of entitlement and shame through collaborative storying, interweaving our own biographies with a re-analysis of student interviews from two prior studies.

ID SCIENCE
AB A recently published article on the cognitive functioning of coloured women, authored by five Stellenbosch University academics received much criticism from those in the academy and those outside. The public outcry focused mainly on racial essentialism evident in the article. But, there were also other criticisms, which focused on the scientific merit of the article, the peer-review process and ethical regulation at Stellenbosch University. In this article, I revisit some of the criticisms levelled against the research reported in the article, which was published in the journal Aging, Neuropsychology and Cognition, and argue that criticisms raised in the wake of the publication should be contextualised within broader debates. I aver that our response to racism in science should not concern merely exorcising racism from science content but that modern western science needs to be decolonised. Furthermore, an analysis of peer-review and ethical regulation in the Nieuwoudt et al. (2019) case should not focus simply on whether reviewers did their work or not, but that the dominant systems of peer-review and ethics creep in the neoliberal university should come under scrutiny.

AB skilled talent. The findings show how neo-racism and neo-nationalism mayThis study demonstrates ways that geopolitics may interfere with the pursuit of global science. In particular, the study sought to understand the impact of the U.S. Department of Justice's China Initiative on the U.S. scien-tific community, especially among those of Chinese and other Asian descent. Based on a survey of about 2,000 scientists in top U.S. research universities, findings show a consistent pattern of neo-racism, neo-nationalism, and the consequences for future international collaborations and maintaining highly be sabotaging the efforts of the U.S. to be globally competitive.

AB This study tested the effect of a message describing a social norm of egalitarian attitudes and behaviors in an engineering college on male students' attitudes and behavioral intentions surrounding diversity in engineering. Participants were first-semester university students enrolled in four sections of an introductory engineering course in two academic terms (Fall 2009 and Fall 2011). At the beginning of the semester, students in two of the four sections received the egalitarian social norms message in the form of an oral presentation given by a senior White male faculty member (social norms message condition). Students in the other two sections did not receive this presentation (control condition). At the end of the semester, all students were invited to complete a survey. Results from a sample of 129 students showed that compared to the control condition, male students in the social norms message condition had stronger intentions to speak out against racist behaviors in their engineering courses and teams, and (among White compared to racial minority men) more positive attitudes toward diversity in engineering. These results suggest that setting a tone of egalitarianism and intolerance of bias for incoming students could help create a more inclusive environment in a White male-dominated educational setting such as a college of engineering.

AB This study uses Critical Race Theory and the Politics of Domestication as guiding frameworks to investigate the experiences of a Woman Faculty of Color science teacher-educator. The experiences focus on the status quo of race relations in science teacher education and how they are revealed through everyday practices, interactions, and the culture in a teacher education department. Two CRT tenets, racism is a normal part of society and interest convergence, highlight how science teacher education still primarily operates centered in whiteness.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; DIVERSITY; CLIMATE; PERCEPTIONS; LEADERSHIP
AB For decades, racial incidents have routinely occurred on college campuses. But today, news about them is more quickly and widely shared because of the public's access to technology. In response, it is common for senior-level administrators to release statements about racial incidents after an institution receives widespread negative publicity. This study is an analysis of 18 statements issued by college presidents. Each statement is in response to a racial incident that occurred over 3 academic years (2012-2015). Findings reveal how college presidents' statements broadly mention the racial incident itself, regularly address the group or individual who committed the racist act, but usually do not acknowledge the systemic or institutional issues that foster racial hostility on college campuses. Because racist behaviors on college campuses have been constant, the need to address concerns about racial issues will continue, and this study offers a new perspective on evaluating college presidents' responses to highly publicized racial incidents in higher education.

AB Women from racially/ethnically minoritized communities remain significantly underrepresented at all levels of education in STEM. The pervasive white and heteronormative culture of the STEM environment has contributed to Women of Color feeling isolated, hyper-visible, and invisible as they contend with racism, sexism, and gendered racial microaggressions. Scholars have found that counterspaces are key sites to support the persistence of Women of Color in STEM and ameliorate the negative psychological effects of navigating oppressive STEM milieus. Missing from the current literature is research on how counterspaces contribute to Women of Color's STEM persistence. This study sought to fill this gap in the literature by understanding the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color in the I CAN PERSIST STEM initiative, a multigenerational counterspace designed to support the holistic persistence of Women of Color in STEM. Steeped in the theoretical conceptualization of counterspaces, and using a case study methodological approach, we found that the multigenerational counter-storytelling and support from Women of Color in STEM, as well as the embodiment of holistic wellness, and justice-focused mentor-teaching supported STEM persistence intentions among undergraduate Women of Color in the sample. Furthermore, participants described being able to reconcile their STEM identities with their need to be active in addressing and mitigating the inequities in their communities, while also prioritizing their well-being and rejecting the STEM culture of overwork and burnout.

AB OrgoPrep, a summer preparatory program integrating multipleactive-learningelements (i.e., interactive videos with problem-solving and feedback,synchronous peer-led instruction, and collaborative work), was previouslyshown to improve academic outcomes in organic chemistry for all students.The present study examined how OrgoPrep differentially impacted studentsbelonging to historically marginalized groups, including those identifyingas women, Black, Hispanic, or first-generation as well as those classifiedas low-income. As a result of multifaceted systemic barriers, thesestudents receive lower grades and leave STEM at higher rates comparedto their peers, highlighting the need for equity-focused educationalinterventions. Drawing upon Quantitative Critical Race Theory, educationaldebts in organic chemistry owed by society were calculated for eachmarginalized group. As a result of participating in OrgoPrep, educationaldebts in GPA points were reduced or mitigated for nearly all marginalizedgroups, with the largest benefits seen in Black students. Disproportionatelylarger mitigative impacts on attrition measured via drop, failure,and withdrawal (DFW) rates were detected for nearly all marginalizedgroups. Specifically, debts in the DFW rate were reduced for womenand low-income students and eliminated for Black and Hispanic students.These findings demonstrate that OrgoPrep can appreciably reduce educationaldebts due to racism and sexism with a mixed impact on debts due toclassism. Similar supplementary programs may play a key role in mitigatingthe effects of racism, sexism, and classism in the STEM pipeline.

AB In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis onrecognitionandemotions, as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.

AB This paper analyzes the debates on "interracial competition" and "racial extinction" in the biological discourse on human evolution during the second half of the nineteenth century. Our intention is to discuss the ideological function of these biological concepts as tools for the naturalization and scientific legitimation of racial hierarchies during that period. We argue that the examination of these scientific discussions about race from a historical perspective can play the role of a critical platform for students and teachers to think about the role of science in current othering processes, such as those related to biomedical technosciences. If they learn how biological ideas played an ideological function concerning interracial relationships in the past, they can be compelled to ask which ideological functions the biological knowledge they are teaching and learning might play now. If this is properly balanced, they can eventually both value scientific knowledge for its contributions and have a critical appraisal of some of its implications. We propose, here, a number of initial design principles for the construction of teaching sequences about scientific racism and science-technology-society relationships, yet to be empirically tested by iterative cycles of implementation in basic education and teacher education classrooms.

TI Undergraduates' awareness of White and male privilege in STEM

DT Article
DE Race; Gender; Undergraduates; Qualitative research
ID DOUBLE BIND; SCIENCE; WOMEN; RACE
AB Background It is well-documented that experiences in STEM courses for women and students of color are different from the experiences of White men. As part of a larger interview study, 183 college seniors from diverse gender and race backgrounds were asked their thoughts on whether the experience of being a STEM major was different for people of different races and genders. We use a framework of "science as White property", derived from critical race theory, to frame this study and results. Results White men were largely unaware of any impact of race or gender. In contrast, women of color overwhelmingly report, consistent with results from a large body of prior research, that both race and gender impact their experiences as STEM majors. Students who acknowledged race and gender impacts did not always attribute these impacts to cultural or systemic factors (i.e., some reported women are underrepresented because they are less interested in STEM rather than a structural reason). Impacts identified that were attributable to systemic factors included impacts related to being a demographic minority (i.e., intimidation, feeling out of place, feeling pressure to work harder) and/or discrimination (i.e., job discrimination, bias against women or people of color and cultural assumptions implying the superiority of White people and men). A small number of students (mostly White women) stated that women or people of color benefit from their underrepresented status, often attributing this benefit to a perception of extra encouragement and opportunities. A common theme across categorizations was that women and students of color work harder than men and White people either because they are perceived to be harder workers or as a response to the sexism and racism they encounter. Conclusions We found that White men are largely unaware of the impacts of race or gender on the pursuit of a STEM degree. Additionally, with the exception of women of color, students are less likely to perceive race as having an impact on the experiences of students than gender. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future work related to gender and race representation in STEM.

AB We frame teachers' contextualization of mathematics (CoM) as a classroom-based identity resource. We explore CoM in secondary classrooms in the segregated school landscape of the US, focusing specifically on schools that serve primarily low-income Black and Latinx students. We review literature that discusses commonly-cited affordances for CoM according to formative, affective, functional literacy, and critical literacy rationales and problematize those rationales relative to prior research. We analyze 58 lessons from 12 classrooms at 11 schools to reveal patterns in CoM relative to those commonly cited affordances. The formative, affective, and functional literacy rationales were frequently evident. Teachers draw largely on generic human experiences and marketplace contexts, positioning students as consumers or employees. There were few instances of CoM naming racism or inequality, and our analysis further reveals blind spots in these efforts. Our discussion considers the implications of these patterns.

AB Perceived racial microaggressions by White super-visors were examined through a qualitative analysis of 10 self-identified Black doctoral supervisees in counseling and clinical psychology. Results indicated 7 microaggression themes directed toward this group: (a) invalidating racial-cultural issues, (b) making stereotypic assumptions about Black clients, (c) making stereotypic assumptions about Black supervisees, (d) reluctance to give performance feedback for fear of being viewed as racist, (e) focusing primarily on clinical weaknesses, (f) blaming clients of color for problems stemming from oppression, and (g) offering culturally insensitive treatment recommendations. The impact of these racial microaggressions was found to be detrimental to Black trainees, the supervisory relationship, and, indirectly, to clients of color. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study examined factors that played a role in Latina/o undergraduate students' persistence in engineering at a Hispanic serving institution (HSI; N = 10) using the consensual qualitative research method (CQR; Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997). Data analyses resulted in five domains: institutional conditions, additive intersectional burdens, personal and cultural wealth, coping skills, and engineering identity. Participants described how they persisted in the face of stressors, citing specific coping skills they developed over time as well as general personal and cultural strengths they carried with them into their pursuit of engineering. Although the structures of the students' institution were generally described as supportive, Latina participants reported experiences with gendered racism that created added barriers to their persistence in engineering. Supportive institutional conditions, personal and cultural assets, and adaptive coping strategies appeared to facilitate the development of a strong engineering identity, which helped to solidify students' sense of belonging, pride, and commitment to complete their degree. Results highlight the need to address intersecting experiences of privilege and oppression to promote access and equity for Latinas/os in engineering.

AB Despite growing efforts, diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have yet to address long-standing engineering participation disparities. Often, diversity and inclusion issues, along with other societal challenges, are perceived as unrelated to engineering. Conversely, engineering as currently practiced and taught is embedded in dominant culture norms that are frequently invisible to the majority of the students and faculty. One strategy to shift this erroneous "neutral" perspective is to integrate diversity and inclusion into engineering curricula. Using inclusive professional identities as a theoretical lens, we developed an activity that incorporates diversity and inclusion into the technical content of Engineering Mechanics: Statics. Using thematic analysis, we found that students' responses to prompts about their identities, engineering as a profession, and their perceived learning revealed two primary themes: teamwork and engineering/math-related skills/experiences. Although diversity and inclusion were included in responses, students did not connect diversity and inclusion to engineering as a profession. Therefore, students might need more support to make this connection. Although singular activities cannot explicitly overcome racism, sexism, or other deeply entrenched biases in our society, the activity type we describe might help students develop a more holistic perspective of engineering and understand the importance of addressing biases in their future engineering careers.

AB This longitudinal case study utilizes critical race theory methodology to chronicle the journey of an African American female in science teacher education. The study looks at her educational history first as a young child and then how she navigates a contested, racialized predominantly White teacher education program, grows and develops in science education, and secures her first full-time teaching appointment as an elementary teacher. The implications for practice in both teacher education and science education show that educational and emotional support for teachers of color throughout their educational and professional journey is imperative to increasing and sustaining Black teachers. In addition, intersectionality foregrounds and adds to the complexity of understanding race, racism, and science in teacher education.

AB The lack of minority representation within academic science means that women of color are often isolated from each other. Isolation limits women of color ability to form supportive networks to deal with the stressors that result from bias and discrimination. Isolation can also prevent women of color from creating support networks that may buffer against stressors. We used a grounded approach to explore the extent to which being the "only" woman of color, versus one of a few, mediates the experiences of incivility, harassment, and broader discriminatory practices experienced by science faculty across rank. We ran six focus groups with a total of 15 women of color science faculty at a research-intensive Midwestern university to explore these themes. Our research supports previous findings that women of color of all ranks experience negative workplace experiences such as incivility and harassment, and the exclusion of women of color occurs at both institutional and interpersonal levels. Our findings yielded new insights into how experiences of social isolation lead to the internalization of gaslighting messages that deny or minimize the occurrence of incivility and harassment. We also found that social support helps women to contextualize their experiences, allowing them to recognize and identify it within the broader cultural patterns of sexism and racism. Social exclusion and isolation intensify the negative psychological impact of negative workplace experiences, whereas social support validates women of color negative experiences and helps externalize these events. Therefore, we suggest that the level of isolation experienced by women of color faculty can mediate the relationship between negative experiences in academic science and personal and professional outcomes such as mental health and productivity. We use this model of psychological impacts of incivility and harassment to suggest future areas of research regarding women of color in STEM.

AB Video games, as technological and cultural artifacts of considerable influence in the contemporary society, play an important role in the construction of identities, just as other artifacts (e.g., books, newspapers, television) played for a long time. In this paper, we discuss this role by considering video games under two concepts, othering and technopoly, and focus on how these concepts demand that we deepen our understanding of the ethics of video games. We address here how the construction of identities within video games involves othering process, that is, processes through which, when signifying and identifying 'Ourselves', we create and marginalize ` Others'. Moreover, we discuss how video games can play an important role in the legitimation of the technopoly, understood as a totalitarian regime related to science, technology and their place in our societies. Under these two concepts, understanding the ethics of video games goes beyond the controversy about their violence. The main focus of discussion should lie in how the ethics of video games is related to their part in the formation of the players' citizenship. Examining several examples of electronic games, we consider how video games provide a rich experience in which the player has the opportunity to develop a practical wisdom (phronesis), which can lead her to be a virtuous being. However, they can be also harmful to the moral experiences of the subjects when they show unethical contents related to othering processes that are not so clearly and openly condemned as violence, as in the cases of sexism, racism or xenophobia. Rather than leading us to conclude that video games needed to be banned or censored, this argument makes us highlight their role in the (science) education of critical, socially responsible, ethical, and politically active citizens, precisely because they encompass othering processes and science, technology, and society relationships.

AB In this article, we explore our experienced tensions as we accepted responsibility for the privilege of our lived experiences towards becoming antiracist mathematics teacher educators. We employed a collaborative self-study to examine and uncover the ways in which existing systemic barriers were mirrored in our own practices. Weekly dialogue centered on self-assigned readings as they pertained to our teaching. Qualitative data sources included agendas, reflections, transcripts of dialogue, and course materials. We experienced multiple tensions, and found that engaging in rehearsals afforded us opportunities to move beyond inaction and grapple with our internalized racism. While our critical friendship provided an avenue to monitor our (in)actions and apply dialogue to rehearse and lean into our tensions, we experienced many missteps and failed to consider our identities. Our experienced tensions may be common to other White teacher educators who also stand at this critical nexus.

ID PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH
AB The right to science has been identified in multiple human rights treaties; however, there has not been a clear framework for how governments or research organizations can advance this right particularly ensuring equitable engagement of people with intellectual disability (ID) in the process of scientific research. Although the feasibility and impacts of engaging people with ID in the process of science have been repeatedly demonstrated there remain systemic barriers including ableism, racism, and other systems of oppression that sustain inequities. Researchers in the ID field must take steps to dismantle systemic barriers and advance participatory approaches that advance equity in the process and outcomes of science.

TI Perceived consequences of evolution: College students perceive negative
   personal and social impact in evolutionary theory
SO SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-SELECTION; CONCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEF
AB Evolutionary science has consequences for individuals and society, ranging from the way we interpret human behavior to our notions of spirituality and the purpose of our existence. Popular portrayals of evolution depict a paradoxical theory, a source of knowledge and human connections, but also a threat to our humanity and freedom. Using quantitative and qualitative methodology, we examined how college-educated adults (n = 135) from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds perceive the impact of evolutionary theory on individuals and society. We identified a continuum of perspectives, ranging from strong creationist to strong evolutionist. Using the model of "knowledge as an ecology" (Demastes, Good, & Peebles, Science Education, 79,637-666,1995; Nardi & O'Day, Information ecologies: Using technology with heart, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1999), we examined the relationships among participants' beliefs, their perceptions regarding the social and personal impact of evolutionary theory, their prior exposure to and knowledge of evolutionary theory, and their opinions regarding the teaching of evolution. Evolutionists and creationists differed in their prior exposure to evolutionary theory, and their opinions about some aspects of teaching, but showed striking similarities regarding perceived impact. All groups viewed the consequences of accepting evolutionary principles in a way that might be considered undesirable: increased selfishness and racism, decreased spirituality, and a decreased sense of purpose and self-determination. From a science education perspective, this one-sided interpretation is troublesome because it runs counter to the available evidence and theories in evolutionary science, and we consider ways of fostering more balanced presentation and appraisal of evolutionary theory.

TI Decolonial scientific education to combat 'science for domination'
SO CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DE Decoloniality; Domination; Paulo Freire; Dialogicity; Interculturality
ID KNOWLEDGE
AB In this article, we argue that mainstream science education is contaminated by neoliberal values and functions in the service of political domination and exploitation and that a neoliberal and exploitative science education does not contribute to the building of a sustainable and just world. The work from Paulo Freire and Enrique Dussel underpin the tenets of decolonial pedagogies. We draw on their work to analyze how decolonial pedagogies have been developed in Latin America. We carried out a literature review in Brazil and found two different ways of approaching decoloniality in science education: (a) studies that start from hybrid, interstitial spaces, as an enunciative locus that allows the construction of other logics of thought and (b) studies dedicated to denouncing the colonial power project from an anti-racist education that contests coloniality and oppression. We present examples of Freirean educational practices and proposals in science education that illustrate how decolonial pedagogies can reveal the coloniality of power/being/knowledge and potentialities of intercultural dialogues. We conclude with an explanation of how and why Freirean dialogicity and affection can counter science for domination.

AB Gendered and racialized barriers play a significant role in undergraduate students'interest and persistence in engineering. While sexist and racist environments have been widely investigated in engineering academic settings, the impediments to equity in work-related engineering socialization experiences are far less explored. Specific to undergraduate students' work settings, internships serve as anticipatory socialization experiences where students learn what it is like to work in certain fields. Yet, little is known about the cues that sponsoring companies provide to potential interns about organizational ideology and power. Drawing from 122 advertisements for college engineering internships, this study explored companies' language and linguistic tools in ads. Within a framework of signaling theory and feminist critical discourse analysis, we used document analysis to examine organizational statements of equal employment and diversity as well as (implicitly gendered and racialized) power structures signaled by linguistic tools (e.g., nominative personal pronouns). Findings reveal a lack of specificity in companies' explicit statements, suggesting that "diversity" language evades identifying concrete equity efforts. Further, results illustrate the complex nature of how companies used linguistic tools to promote their own diversity values and position interns'agency. Leveraging a feminist lens, we discuss how leaving inclusive practices and power structures unnamed may signal a performative commitment to equity. We conclude with implications for higher education researchers, practitioners in career services, and employers recruiting college interns.

AB In this study, we explore how preservice secondary science teachers articulated their agency and structural awareness within racist-nativist policy and schooling environments that limit emergent bilingual students' opportunities to learn science. Our praxis-oriented analysis led us to characterize novice teacher participants' discursive positionings within this structure-agency dialectic-that is, what it means to teach science well with emergent bilingual learners in the context of structural exclusions-as deficit, distancing, or discerning. We then discuss how these preservice teacher positionings were a function of tension management for working within the structure-agency dialectic. In our discussion, we refer to this phenomenon as praxis crisis, that is, the disjuncture between theory and practice that occurs as teachers negotiate the real and perceived constraints of their work. We consider how the concept of praxis crisis that emerged from our work can be a critical dialogic tool for transformative learning in science teacher education research and practice, and how a praxis-oriented methodological approach can support more expansive and nuanced understandings of teacher learning.

DE Early Childhood; Critical Race Theory, and Technology
AB Technology Segregation is ongoing practice within early childhood programs in the United States. This research, which is a part 451 a larger study, reveals that school segregation and technology segregation are one in the same. Utilizing Critical Race Theory, as the theoretical framework, this research finds that young Black children are denied technological access directly affecting their learning trajectories. PTO fundraising and other monetary donations to public schools vary by district and neighborhood and are based on segregation. Therefore, structural racism flourishes within these early childhood programs as Black students are excluded from another important content area and practice.

AB Using previously collected data from a multi-site, mixed methods longitudinal study, we operationalize a conceptual frame of invisibility to describe and understand the phenomenon of erasure that some Boys of Color experienced by teachers in science learning environments where most others were hyper-visible (and subsequently hyper-criminalized). Recentering these invisible Boys of Color revealed three descriptive categories: (a) introversion, (b) newcomers, and (c) frequently absent. In detailing these categories and their associated narratives and labels, we complexify our understandings of the lived experiences of Boys of Color in science education and offer frameworks for ways in which teacher education can equip pre-service and in-service science teachers to disrupt these insidious and sophisticated forms of systemic racism.

AB Although models of campus climate for diversity exist, there is little research about the role of technology in campus climate. The present study investigated how technology, such as digital devices, digital literacy, digital mediums, and digitally mediated communication, function in relation to campus climate among students who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color at a Predominantly White Institution using data from in-depth interviews. Specifically, lacking access to digital devices or training for how to use the type of technology used in classes (i.e., digital literacy) can be a barrier to inclusion in interactions in classrooms and online. However, technology can also be a tool that supports social and academic interactions. Digitally mediated communication can mirror or amplify prejudice, discrimination, and marginalization occurring in physical spaces in digital spaces. Finally, digitally mediated communication can enable students to connect to the institution and readily identify and compare institutional responses to racist events on campus and draw conclusions about institutional values and priorities. Directions for future research and the implications for institutions of higher education are discussed.

ID STRUCTURAL RACISM; EQUITY
AB The convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter Movement, and the public anguish and outrage resulting from the murder of George Floyd in 2020 intensified the commitment of many health care institutions to pursue racial and social justice and achieve health equity. The authors describe the Road Map for Action to Address Racism, which was developed to unify and systematize antiracism efforts across the Mount Sinai Health System. A 51-member Task Force to Address Racism, comprising faculty, staff, students, alumni, health system leaders, and trustees, developed recommendations to achieve the goal of becoming an antiracist and equitable health care and learning institution by intentionally addressing all forms of racism and promoting greater diversity, inclusion, and equity for its workforce and community. Grounded in the principles of Collective Impact, the Task Force developed a set of 11 key strategies to effect systemwide change. The strategies affected all aspects of the organization: business systems and financial operations, delivery of care, workforce development and training, leadership development, medical education, and community engagement. The authors describe Road Map implementation, currently in process, including the appointment of strategy leaders, evolution of a governance structure integrating stakeholders from across the health system, development of an evaluation framework, communication and engagement efforts, and process measures and progress to date. Lessons learned include the importance of recognizing the work of dismantling racism as integral to, not apart from, the institution's day-to-day work, and the need for specialized expertise and a significant investment of time to coordinate Road Map implementation. Going forward, rigorous assessment of quantitative and qualitative outcomes and a commitment to sharing successes and challenges will be critical to eradicating systems that have perpetuated inequities in the biomedical sciences and medicine and in the delivery of health care.

AB Racial bias in research impacts a study's relevancy, validity and reliability, though presently this aspect is not addressed in critical appraisal tools, and consequently appraisers may not take racial bias into account when assessing a paper's quality. Drawing on critical race theory (CRT) tenets that racism is ubiquitous and race a social construct, this paper discusses concerns regarding racism in research which have been broadly divided into two categories for critical appraisers to consider: the underrepresentation of minoritised ethnic groups in health studies, especially where minoritised populations see higher rates of disease occurrence and; the utilisation of racial/ethnicity data to interpret disparities in outcomes, including speculation of biological race, the misinterpretation of genetic ancestry as race, and the lack of investigation into social determinants of health, including systemic, institutional and interpersonal forms of racism. The injustices exposed in this paper impact the health of minoritised ethnic groups and are therefore a Black Lives Matter issue. They risk resurrecting dangerous theories regarding biological inferiority among minoritised ethnic populations, as well as hindering study findings. The application of CRT frameworks in health science research quality appraisal is discussed in relation to the above themes - using largely UK-based contexts with supporting examples from the US - followed by recommendations for critically appraising for antiracism. Further information to support critically appraising for antiracism can be found via https://www.criticallyappraisingantiracism.org/.

TI ''Yo soy indigena'': identifying and using traditional ecological

SO CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Gender; Traditional ecological knowledge; Science education; Guatemala
AB This study examines how traditional ecological knowledge-TEK-can be identified and utilized to create culturally responsive science learning opportunities for Maya girls from a community in the Guatemalan highlands. Maya girls are situated in a complex socio-historical and political context rooted in racism and sexism. This study contextualizes the current situation of Maya women and girls in Guatemala and emphasizes the important need for educators to create science-learning opportunities that are culturally congruent. The author posits that when considering how to make the teaching and learning of science culturally responsive for Maya girls, educators must begin with the scientific knowledge inherent within Maya communities. Indigenous communities have a wealth of TEK that can be used to contextualize science curricula that can be purposely designed to meet the nuanced cultural needs of traditional Maya girls within and outside Guatemala.

AB Grounded in critical race theory and a burgeoning field of Black feminist technology studies, this article takes a techno-structural approach to understanding the promise and peril of internet technology to support activism, transformational resistance and counter-storytelling for Black college-agewomen. Qualitative interviews with 17 Black undergraduate women reveal multiple benefits of leveraging social media for racial justice, as well as the socioemotional and academic consequences of algorithmic racism. These findings support the need to develop new conceptual frameworks that can foster students' sociotechnical consciousness, and further equip them with the critical race techno-literacies needed to disrupt anti-Blackness both on and offline.

ID NO-EXCUSES; WHITE TEACHERS; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; CRITIQUE; EQUITY
AB Background/Context:In New Orleans, Louisiana, in the years following Hurricane Katrina, predominantly white education reformers have used entrepreneurial support to dismantle the predominantly Black city's public education system. Using racial domination without community approval, these education reformers have educationally disenfranchised the Black community by implementing No Excuses (NE) Charter School Management Organizations (CMO). The rise in these organizations has also led to the mass firing of the city's majority Black educator base and the hiring of majority white educators. Scholarship on NE CMOs notes their use of dehumanizing behavioral practices meant to control their student populations. Accounts, however, are limited from those who have witnessed, experienced, or resisted these dehumanizing behavioral practices. Purpose/Objective/Focus of Study:Through the critical race theory (CRT) lens of racial realism, this paper provides a critical race personal counternarrative (CRPCN) that characterizes the racist and racialized disciplinary and surveillance practices used to control Black students' bodies. It examines my experiences as a teacher within an NE CMO, the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) school in New Orleans. Furthermore, this paper underscores my own Black fugitive pedagogic acts alongside my Black students, acts that allowed us to create fleeting moments of freedom inside and outside our classroom. Research Design:I relied on critical race methodology to construct a CRPCN against KIPP, which prides itself on positive behavior practices and social justice. The evidence I drew on included free-written notes, conversations with former students and teachers, media (e.g., photos and videos), and scholarly literature. To analyze data, I drew on CRT concepts of racial realism and the permanence of racism in U.S. society to underscore Black fugitivity, anti-Black surveillance, and discipline. Conclusion/Recommendations:Racial realism provides a lens for identifying the evolution of racialized surveillance technologies on Black bodies within the United States. Although critics characterize racial realism as overly pessimistic, this paper notes one way that scholars, educators, students, and parents can draw on this tool of racial resistance to accept the current racial reality, uncover racially oppressive schooling practices, and highlight strategies of survival through fugitive acts.

TI "I Know I Have to Work Twice as Hard and Hope That Makes Me Good
   Enough": Exploring the Stress and Strain of Black Doctoral Students in
   Engineering and Computing
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English

AB Background/Context: It is well documented that Black doctoral students in engineering and computing fields experience more stress and strain during doctoral training than their White and Asian peers. However, few studies have examined how Black engineering and computing doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers experience these challenges and stressors or focused on the psychological effects, behavioral responses, or health costs for these students.
   We interviewed 48 Black PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in engineering and computing departments to find out how they describe, make sense of and cope with stressors and strains in their training programs. Study participants (29 men and 19 women) ranged from. first-year doctoral students to recent PhDs. Students attended various institutions and institution types, primarily in eastern and central time zones. Nine participants attended historically Black colleges and universities, and though we anticipated that their experiences would be vastly different, their experiences closely resembled those of students in other institutions.
   Research Design: Each person participated in either an individual interview or focus getup Data were collected via video- and audio-recording. All focus groups took place at either a national engineering/computing-related conference or at the students' home institutions. Twenty-three participants were interviewed, while the remainder participated in focus groups of three to five students (maximum of ten). Interviews and focus groups were semistructured, using open-ended questions but allowing some flexibility to develop new ideas and order topics differently.
   Data Collection and Analysis: This study employed transcendental phenomenology, using three steps to investigate and make meaning of participants' experiences: examining the phenomenon with intentionality, eidetic reduction, and constitution of meaning. Transcendental reduction allowed for examining the experience of Black doctoral students in engineering and computing in general and separating what the research perspectives supplied from what our intuitions offered, guided by our theoretical frameworks of role strain and racial battle fatigue. Transcendental phenomenology also gave the authors a context to examine and disclose our own experiences and feelings.
   Findings: Consistent with prior research on role strain and John Henryism (i.e., trying to overcome a chronic stressor by working harder), we found that seeking success in training, employment, work, or career was more important to these Black graduate students and postdocs than safeguarding their mental or physical health. Meeting the demands of a PhD program or postdoctoral fellowship were critical priorities congruent with their phase of life. Their focus and sacrifice may have helped them complete their degrees, but our findings suggest that these strategies exacted psychological, emotional, and physical costs.
   The study deepened our understanding of significant interrelated dynamics for this population in four key ways. We found that (a) the stresses and strains made students question their qualifications; (b) racialized experiences were often the source of stress, strain, and academic performance anxiety; (c) discordance between the racial make-up of their academic environments and their racialized engineering and computing identities appeared to exacerbate impostor phenomenon; and (d) the students' proactive coping mechanisms took an emotional toll. Participants discussed the nature and sources of their feelings of self-doubt.
   The implications extend beyond the dwindling numbers of Black students earning STEM doctorates; this racial climate also affects the academic workforce and the professional landscape. Although Black researchers who leave academia after completing doctoral training can influence scientific innovation through other positions, it is alarming and problematic that potentially qualified future professors are dissuaded from pursuing academic careers because of their training experiences. Their absence from faculty can hinder critical innovation, breakthroughs, and the training of succeeding generations of scholars who might have learned from and collaborated with them.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The added stress, strain, and toll on Black students' well-being is an underappreciated reason for their relinquishing of academic careers. Our findings illustrate the students' resilience and strength. Continued research on added stressors (e.g., impostor syndrome, racialized stress) and strengths could add much-needed consideration of cultural, structural, and interpersonal racism and the ways that Black students earning doctoral degrees in STEM fields manage to succeed despite cultural and institutional barriers. Future research should explore how to modify the microculture of STEM programs and departments to allow Black students to feel that these are healthy, safe, and fair spaces in which they can make contributions. Otherwise, an invaluable diversity of perspectives may disappear altogether from academic environments. In addition, diversifying the faculty and students in doctoral engineering and computing programs could help to reduce impostor syndrome, isolation, and other damaging psychological stress. Forthcoming research, programs, and policies should consider what Black students in STEM endure, because simply surviving racially toxic environments should not be the end goal.

AB In this critical multisite case study we examined the concept of colorblind mentoring. Using Bonilla-Silva's Colorblind Racism Frames, we sought to understand White faculty members' perspectives on their mentoring of Students of Color. The findings revealed that White faculty members often engage with students from a "colorblind perspective." Their use of race-neutral, colorblind language (avoiding racial terms but implying them) allowed White faculty members to describe their students as academically inferior, less prepared, and less interested in pursuing research and graduate studies while potentially ignoring structural causes. Faculty perceptions of students may influence the way Students of Color perceive their academic abilities and potential to achieve success in STEM disciplines and in graduate education.

ID AMERICAN; MATHEMATICS; TEACHERS; IDENTITY; SOUTH
AB Racism, sexism, and classism at the societal level permeate all levels of education, and conversely, schooling reproduce social inequity. These inequities are compounded by the objective, apolitical approach that some teachers bring to science teaching. Research shows that Black female teachers continue to be more comfortable and committed to working in schools with Black and Brown students. This study presents qualitative data exploring how 21 Black women science teachers at various levels of expertise discuss and practice Womanist Pedagogy. I argue that Black women science teachers would benefit greatly from learning about the pedagogical practices of Black women teachers from the past, learning that they are not alone in the fight for classrooms built with love and informed by their lived racialized, classed, and gendered experiences. The tenets of Womanist Pedagogy can be used as a tool to showcase the power Black women bring to the science education community.

AB The purpose of education is to understand and help address local and global problems to better society and the world. A key player in this endeavor should be STEM education, which has the potential to equip learners with the skills and knowledge necessary to address intersectional issues such as climate change, health and income disparities, racism, and political divisions. However, in this article we argue that despite the transformative potential of STEM education, it remains far removed from most people's lived experiences and is detached from the real-world social, political, and economic contexts in which it exists. This detachment not only perpetuates existing inequities by failing to meet the specific needs and reflect the experiences of these communities, but it also hampers STEM education's capacity to address the very local and global problems it is purported to solve. By remaining removed from the tangible, real-world contexts in which it exists, STEM education cannot fully harness its potential to better humanity. To address these issues, we propose humanizing STEM education by intentionally and explicitly grounding all work in the recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of all students, regardless of their background. We begin the article by critically examining the typically unspoken pre-existing assumptions or "agreements" that govern and dictate the norms of teaching and learning within STEM, ways of approaching framing STEM education that we often take for granted as necessary and true. We propose new agreements that expand the ways in which we think about STEM education, in hopes of making STEM education more accessible, inclusive, relevant, responsive, and reparative. Throughout, we deliberate on the notion of being human. We argue that to envision a future of humanistic STEM, one that is intentionally grounded in an ethics of care and equity for all, including the environment, it is necessary to continue to make visible and reimagine the unarticulated assumptions that underlie our current approaches to STEM education and practice.

AB This article is about introducing Critical Race Design (CRD), a research methodology that centers race and equity at the nucleus of educational opportunities by design. First, the authors define design-based implementation research (DBIR; Penuel, Fishman, Cheng, & Sabelli, 2011) as an equity-oriented education research methodology where teaching and learning is informed by robust, iterative, evidence-based research conducted by multiple stakeholders. Next, they provide a brief overview of Critical Race Theory in Education (CRT; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995) as a theoretical and methodological approach that aims to unpack and disrupt the structural inequities experienced by disenfranchised racial groups. They then describe how both education methodologies informed CRD, our emerging anti-racist critical design methodology. Finally, they provide an example where they used CRD to design an online service-learning course that aimed to situate the narratives of underrepresented STEM professionals as a curricular resource for nondominant adolescents.

AB The study of the identity processes of women of color in science-based fields helps us (a) find ways to support similar women, and (b) study the dynamics of inequity, within and beyond science. Participants in this study (a Black woman, a Latina, and an American Indian woman) survived inadequate high schools and discouraging college science departments to win formal recognition (fellowships, publications). Using multiracial feminist theory, including intersectionality, and practice theory, we conceptualize authoring of identity as an ongoing process. Qualitative methods were designed around Black feminist precepts of caring and personal accountability, the use of concrete experience and of dialogue (Collins, 2000a). Participants' opportunities to author legitimate science identities were constrained by their location in the matrix of oppression. They reported conflicts between their identities as women of color and as credible science students, and having racist, sexist identities ascribed to them. All became more adept at fending off negative ascription and all found settings with less identity conflict; their ability to read a situation and quickly adjust, la facultad (Anzaldua, 1999) helped them survive. But the fact that they have needed to do this is unjust. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Inc. J Res Sci Teach 48: 339-366, 2011

AB The American Chemical Society holds supporting diverse student populations engaging in chemistry as a core value. We analyzed chemical concept inventory scores from 4,612 students across 12 institutions to determine what inequities in content knowledge existed before and after introductory college chemistry courses. We interpreted our findings from a Quantitative Critical (QuantCrit) perspective that framed inequities as educational debts that society owed students due to racism, sexism, or both. Results showed that society owed women and Black men large educational debts before and after instruction. Society's educational debts before instruction were large enough that women and Black men's average scores were lower than White men's average pretest scores even after instruction. Society would have to provide opportunities equivalent to taking the course up to two and a half times to repay the largest educational debts. These findings show the scale of the inequities in the science education systems and highlight the need for reallocating resources and opportunities throughout the K-16 education system to mitigate, prevent, and repay society's educational debts from sexism and racism.

AB Introduction This paper merges two neglected components within the psychological sciences broadly and research methods courses specifically: Critical whiteness and qualitative methodologies. Statement of the Problem In psychology programs, regardless of discipline, research courses remain one area where issues of race and racism, such as critical whiteness, are deemphasized. Similarly, methods courses rarely integrate qualitative inquiry and critical theory. Literature Review First, I briefly review the relevant literature on the state of qualitative research in psychology. I then discuss critical whiteness, contextualizing the idea of whiteness, before moving into a review of the current research on whiteness in psychology. Teaching Implications I present three experiential learning activities that further students' skill development in qualitative methods while learning about three specific aspects of whiteness. Practicing observations, photovoice, and qualitative coding, students can reflect on the pervasiveness of white culture, colorblind racism, and racial microaggressions. Conclusion The activities described in this article provide instructors one avenue to engage various aspects of whiteness and qualitative methods, phenomena routinely overlooked in graduate training.

AB This study explores the affordances and constraints of using the four core practices of ambitious science teaching (AST) as the main curriculum of science methods courses in preparing novice teachers for equitable instruction. Employing a longitudinal qualitative case study approach, this study follows three novice secondary science teachers' trajectories over 3 years, from their preparation to their second year of teaching. Participants were three White women who taught primarily Latinx, English learners, exceptional learners, and/or those who live in poverty. The contemporary vision of science learning promoted by the Next Generation Science Standards and critical race theory guide our analysis of novice teachers' instruction. Findings suggest that using AST practices as the main curriculum of science methods courses can help prepare novice teachers for equity if the approximation of these practices facilitates novices in problematizing their normalized views, expectations, and practices of disciplinary teaching and learning. The core practices are limited, however, in their ability to develop novice teachers' critical consciousness about racism and systemic inequity, which profoundly affects interactions with marginalized youth in classrooms.

AB Social science research has shown us for decades that young children notice racial differences at very young ages and learn societal rules about race throughout childhood. Margaret Hagerman reviews some of the research into children's understandings of race and shares her own observations from conversations with children across racial and class groups. Although their attitudes about race and racism varied, they were aware of the role race plays in contemporary debates related to such issues as police shootings, immigration, and the election of Donald Trump.

DT Article
DE Biological "race'; physical education; commonsense; pedagogy; sport
   sciences
ID RACISM; PEOPLE
AB This paper examines the usage of race' in high school physical education textbooks in Australia. In particular, it examines the concept of biological race' in connection with human performance in sport. DNA studies do not indicate that separate classifiable subspecies (races) exist within modern humans. A content analysis of physical education textbooks in Australia suggests that they are sites that continue to perpetuate myths of race' and the science' related to it. As such the utilization of biological race' as a variable for athletic performance naturalizes embedded biases, is anti-scientific and is potentially indicative of other racist practices within education. Further this commonsense understanding of biological race' continues to develop uncritically and unchecked. University students in the fields of exercise science and physical education generally develop from students who excelled in high school physical education (PE). The power of curriculum and pedagogy result in the reproduction of biological race' that has become reified in the field of physical education.

DT Article
AB In this article, I present a framework that can be used in our work with special groups of gifted students-one that recognizes the effects of socioeconomic status (SES), racism, and other limiting factors on educational achievement and provides a blueprint for interventions. This framework stems from Urie Bronfrenbrenner's ecological theory of development and emphasizes the role of social support systems in the development of talent. I then argue that two important reasons to retain a strong focus on programs that serve minority students include the fact that the gap in achievement between minority and nonminority children is pervasive and exists even at high socioeconomic levels and that minority students' underachievement is largely attributable to cultural factors within our society.

AB In this study, we explored how science teacher candidates construct ideas about science teaching and learning in the context of partnerships with urban community-based organizations. We used a case study design focusing on a group of 10 preservice teachers' participation in educational programming that focused on environmental racism and connected science to larger social issues in an economically dispossessed Mexican community in Chicago. Using theoretical lenses of humanistic science education, justice-centered science pedagogy, and structure-agency dialectic, we studied how preservice high school science teachers made sense of equity and social justice issues facing marginalized communities and how they thought about the goals and nature of science education, along with their role as science teachers, as they participated in a Toxic Tour provided by the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. By emphasizing both environmental challenges and the community assets in Little Village, the Toxic Tour provided an opportunity for science teacher candidates to develop a complex understanding of this particular community and critically reflect on their own communities. The teacher candidates identified both structures that are enabling or disabling for community members and people's individual and collective agency acting upon these structures. They also recognized communities as places of authentic science learning.

AB In engineering education, numerous ranges of diversity are needed. With the growing number of international students, it is essential to enhance the inclusion in higher education. Team-based learning (TBL) has been applied in engineering education to boost diversity and inclusion. This study applied a mixed methods approach, a combination of quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interview) methods, to research the effect of TBL on the diversity and inclusion of Chinese students and British students in the Environmental Engineering programme at one UK university. Nearly 70% of Chinese students considered their learning experiences with British students to be positive or very positive. Approximately 64% of students believed that they learned most when they were "discussing and preparing group seminar work/presentation together in library/classroom/other places". "Enjoying a different culture" and "Learning from others with different educational backgrounds" are two primary reasons for Chinese students liking learning with British teammates. The interviews indicated substantial beneficial effects of TBL on enhancing diversity and inclusion in engineering education. Many students welcome the difference and consider it an opportunity to comprehend the foreign culture. The research results shed light on that embracing diversity and producing an inclusive setting have favourable effects on the academic and social development of engineering students. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated racism in some areas. Due to international travel restrictions, most international students have to study online. Further studies are required to understand the new challenges brought about by the pandemic.

DT Article
DE Black identities; Black collective; Race relations
AB One of the missions of Brazilian universities is to provide, in addition to techniques and science, an integral education that values and respects the human being completely, considering racial, cultural, historical, identity, social class, gender differences, among others. One of the ways of this appreciation can be done through extra classroom activities, such as events, which are held during the various years, on average from four to five, in which students spend at the university. Thus, focusing on anti-racist education, the objective of this article is to understand the relevance of events that deal with racial issues, in the process of affirmation of black identities, at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT), in the view of black teachers and students. and white people, as well as analyzing the dynamics in which these processes take place. The research is qualitative and analyzes the life narratives of these subjects, from an ethno-sociological perspective, based on data from a Master's degree in Education. The research's guiding questions are: is there institutional support for these events? How does this relationship take place? The results indicate that the reflections and discussions provided by these events take place, mainly, after a greater entrance of blacks in the university, mainly by the initiative of the black collectives themselves. From the data, it is clear that the events of these collectives favor the affirmations of black identities and provide an anti-racist education, however, often under pressure and conflicts.

TI "How Do We Do This at a Distance?!" A Descriptive Study of Remote
   Undergraduate Research Programs during COVID-19

DT Article
ID RACE
AB The COVID-19 pandemic shut down undergraduate research programs across the United States. A group of 23 colleges, universities, and research institutes hosted remote undergraduate research programs in the life sciences during Summer 2020. Given the unprecedented offering of remote programs, we carried out a study to describe and evaluate them. Using structured templates, we documented how programs were designed and implemented, including who participated. Through focus groups and surveys, we identified programmatic strengths and shortcomings as well as recommendations for improvements from students' perspectives. Strengths included the quality of mentorship, opportunities for learning and professional development, and a feeling of connection with a larger community. Weaknesses included limited cohort building, challenges with insufficient structure, and issues with technology. Although all programs had one or more activities related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, these topics were largely absent from student reports even though programs coincided with a peak in national consciousness about racial inequities and structural racism. Our results provide evidence for designing remote Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) that are experienced favorably by students. Our results also indicate that remote REUs are sufficiently positive to further investigate their affordances and constraints, including the potential to scale up offerings, with minimal concern about disenfranchising students.

AB Background: Although there has been a pronounced growth in hip-hop-based pedagogy (HHBP) scholarship in recent years, there has not been a concomitant critique of this growing body of work. As a consequence, much of this scholarship is best characterized as advocacy of HHBP.
   Purpose/Objective: The objective of this article is to promote critical discourse around the conceptualization and implementation of HHBP by (a) identifying a set of challenges presented in the conceptualization of HHBP scholarship, (b) describing the narrative that these challenges converge to support, and (c) suggesting an alternative narrative aimed at fostering a more empowering use of HHBP.
   Research Design: To accomplish this objective, we provide an in-depth critique of Emdin and Lee's (2012) article, "Hip-hop, the 'Obama effect,' and urban science education." Through this critique, we first identify eight challenges posed by the authors' argument, as well as the narrative that is the foundation of this argument.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: We conclude by presenting an alternate narrative of hiphop as an instrument of systemic racism and offering suggestions as to how HHBP can be used in both research and practice to both avoid and counter systemic racism.

This research stemmed from the Institution's publication of an offensive catalog cover and the subsequent reactions to its inherent racism. Following this incident, our institution was dubbed 'Cracker State' in the media, informing our decision to analyze the historical connotations of this term for our pre-service educators. Utilizing Critical Whiteness Studies and Southern epistemology frameworks, we reconceptualize White Fragility while pulling from this experience and data collected to advance a strategy for confronting Southern White supremacy. Participants included 154 majority White and female students. Data stemmed from document analysis and two years of empirical data drawn from classroom discussions and student assignments. Due to the demographics and location of our college, we utilize the autobiographical demand of place and pay particular attention to understanding the influence of the South on the development of our students' ideology. We explore this Southern place utilizing the following themes: (1) romantic fictions, (2) the specter of guilt, (3) God's chosen people, and (4) the final great tragedy of the South. The goal is to begin a conversation regarding place-based pedagogy.

AB Despite the increasing number of women receiving bachelor's degrees in computing (i.e., Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, etc.), a closer look reveals that the percentage of Black women in computing has significantly dropped in recent years, highlighting the underrepresentation of Black women and its negative impact on broadening participation in the field of computing. The literature reveals that several K-16 interventions have been designed to increase the representation of Black women and girls in computing. Despite these best efforts, the needle seems to have barely moved in increasing the representation or the retention of Black women in computing. Instead, the primary goals have been to recruit and retain women in the CS pipeline using gender-focused efforts intended to increase the number of women who also identify as members of racialized groups. However, these gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge or appreciate how intersectionality (the overlapping social constructs of gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.) has shaped the lived experiences of Black women navigating the computing pipeline. Without honest dialogue about how power operates in the field of computing, the push for racial equality and social justice in CS education remains an elusive goal. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework to address systemic oppression (i.e., racism, gender discrimination, power, and privilege), we interview 24 Black women in different phases of the computing pipeline about their experiences navigating the field of computing. An intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three primary saturated sites of violence within CS education: (1) traditional K-12 classrooms; (2) predominantly White institutions; and (3) internships as supplementary learning experiences. We conclude the article with implications for how the field of CS education can begin to address racial inequality that negatively impacts Black girls and women, thus contributing to a more equitable and socially just field of study that benefits all students.

TI The Misuse of Genetics: The Dihybrid Cross & the Threat of "Race
   Crossing"
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE Mendelian genetics; eugenics; race; history of biology
AB Biology teachers consider basic Mendelian genetics to be value-free, objective science, immune to misinterpretation and misuse. It may thus come as a surprise to learn that in the early days of genetics a cornerstone of genetics education, the dihybrid cross, was employed to support claims of the racial superiority of whites over blacks and to provide a "scientific" rationale for laws prohibiting interracial marriages. In 1917 the prominent eugenicist Charles B. Davenport warned of the danger of "disharmonious combinations" of physical and behavioral traits in the second generation of "wide race crosses," equivalent to the F-2 generation of a dihybrid cross. He tried and failed to find data to support his arguments in a study of the mixed-race inhabitants of Jamaica. Davenport's analysis was deeply flawed, especially by the racist assumptions underlying this work. Although these events occurred a century ago, biology teachers may still be able to use this regrettable episode as an example of how even the most basic science may be misapplied by those with a social or political agenda.

ID EDUCATION
AB Longstanding inequities in science education across the lines of race and class remain the most intractable problem in the field. Justice-centered science pedagogy is introduced as a theoretical framework built on the traditions of critical pedagogy and culturally relevant pedagogy to address these inequities as components of larger oppressive systems. This study examines how a justice-centered advanced chemistry class in an urban neighborhood high school supported students to succeed academically while taking up urgent issues of social and environmental justice identified by their communities. The findings include evidence that curriculum organized around an issue of environmental racism supported academic achievement that exceeded the expectations of a typical high school chemistry course. The findings also document how the curriculum provided opportunities for students to move beyond academic achievement to position themselves as transformative intellectuals. As transformative intellectuals, students demonstrated complex thinking about science and social justice issues, cultivated their commitment to their communities and cultures of origin, and developed credibility as local youth knowledgeable in science. These findings have implications for teachers, teacher educators, and educational researchers who wish to engage with science education as a catalyst for social transformation.

DE Sex education; Gender equity; Violence against women
AB Violence against women is one of the main forms of violation of human rights. According to the World Health Organization, Brazil ranks 5th in the countries that kill the most women in the world in the domestic and family context. This violence stems from a prejudiced, discriminatory, patriarchal, sexist and racist culture. To combat it, it is necessary, in addition to effective public policies, the integration of the Public Power with the areas of education, through educational actions that disseminate human rights and the ethical values of unrestricted respect for the dignity of the human person with the perspective of gender. In this sense, by means of a bibliographic survey, with a critical analysis of the theme addressed, this work aims to highlight the importance of sex education and the promotion of gender equity in the educational process of learning and socialization, concluding that this education contributes with the formation of critical thinking and with social development and collaborates with the construction of an egalitarian culture, with gender equality and facing all forms of violence, discrimination and prejudice against women.

AB The annual What's Hot in Literacy survey was conducted to determine what topics are currently receiving attention, and how they are being addressed effectively within schools and in the emerging research. Twenty-five literacy experts served as panelists and were interviewed to determine which of the 30 topics were a focus of current attention. The survey results included several topics being classified as "very hot" including: Science of Teaching Reading/Science of Reading, dyslexia, social justice/equity/anti-racism in literacy, cultural and linguistic diversity in literacy, digital literacy, assessment and accountability, and early literacy. Other topics received less attention in 2022 both in the classroom and in emerging research. The included discussion of results and their potential impacts on P-12 classrooms is relevant to teachers, specialists, coaches, administrators, and higher education faculty alike.

AB This article examines the experiences of Chicano/Latino(a) doctoral students at a research-intensive doctorate-granting institution. Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with 24 Chicano/Latino(a) doctoral students across social science, humanities, education, and science disciplines, this qualitative investigation analyzed how disciplinary affiliation mediated the professional socialization experiences of Chicano/Latino(a) doctoral students. Guided by intersectionality and social capital theories, the findings reveal systemic inequities in the doctoral socialization process. Unequal access to professional development opportunities and faculty mentorship were among the most salient challenges experienced by Chicano/Latino(a) doctoral students. On the other hand, supportive peers and faculty mentors served as key socializing agents for respondents. Overall, findings suggest that institutionalized racism, sexism, and classism in the doctoral training process play a significant role in Chicano/Latino(a) doctoral socialization and professional career preparation experiences.

TI The Culture and Justice Quorum at University of California, San Diego: A
   Departmental Approach to Dismantling Structural Racism
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB ProblemStructural racism is embedded within the structure and function of academic medical institutions. Although many institutions have begun to incorporate racial justice within academic medicine, it needs to be integral to every discipline and all aspects of medical education, research, and health system practice. Guidance is lacking, however, on how to create and sustain department-level action to shift culture and encourage antiracist work. ApproachTo address the culture, uphold racial justice, and address the challenges of racism in medicine with dynamic and innovative solutions, the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at University of California, San Diego, formed a Culture and Justice Quorum (the Quorum) in September 2020. All department faculty, residents, fellows, and staff were invited to participate in the Quorum as ambassadors who commit to meet and facilitate Quorum work or as supporters who pledge Quorum support without regular meeting participation. OutcomesIn all, 153 of 155 invited individuals (98.7%) responded, with 36 (23.2%) requesting to participate as ambassadors and 117 (75.5%) as supporters. Quorum ambassadors have worked together to assess the climate of the department, university, and health system, including incorporating input and amplifying efforts of the department's resident leadership council. The Quorum has implemented initiatives to promote health equity and developed a report card to demonstrate activities, monitor progress, and ensure accountability. Next StepsThrough the innovative Culture and Justice Quorum, the department aims to address structural racism, foster justice, and dismantle the foundational injustices embedded within departmental clinical, educational, and research work and within the wider culture. The Quorum offers a model for creating and sustaining department-level action to shift culture and encourage antiracist work. Since established, it has received institutional recognition, including receiving the 2022 Inclusive Excellent Award for Department-Organizational Unit, which recognizes outstanding institutional contributions for inclusion and diversity efforts.

AB Teaching the topic of genetics in relationship to ancestry and race generates many questions, and requires a teaching strategy that encourages perspective-based exploration and discussion. We have developed a set of dialogues for discussing the complex science of genetics, ancestry, and race that is contextualized in real human interactions and that contends with the social and ethical implications of this science. This article provides some brief historical and scientific context for these dialogues, describes their development, and relates how we have used them in different ways to engage diverse groups of science learners. The dialogue series can be incorporated into classroom or informal science education settings. After listening to or performing the dialogues and participating in a discussion, students will: (1) recognize misunderstandings about the relationship between DNA and race; (2) describe how DNA testing services assign geographic ancestry; (3) explain how scientific findings have been used historically to promote institutionalized racism and the role personal biases can play in science; (4) identify situations in their own life that have affected their understanding of genetics and race; and (5) discuss the potential consequences of the racialization of medicine as well as other fallacies about the connection of science and race.

AB This article explores the basis for resistance to the normalizing technologies associated with English-only legislation and resulting educational practices. The dominance of English-only education in US public schools has normalized English first language speakers and English language learning by appropriating the technology of language in order to become Americanized.' Because of the growing number of English language learners (ELL) in US public schools, it is important to understand how the normalizing educational practices and disciplinary power associated with English-only education also cultivate possibilities for resistance. I draw upon Foucault's analytic care of the self to explore the space of English-only education by asking: What alternatives to the normalization of ELL students might be mobilized for resistance?' This analysis suggests that to shift from a normalized American' identity requires questioning the racist and nativist discourse on English-only education, and focusing attention on contradictory and multilayered notions of American'. The article concludes with recommendations for teacher education on how to cultivate prospective teachers' resistance to English-only education.

AB While the Internet offers many opportunities to access information, training and communication, it has created new grounds for risks, threats and harm. With the rise of populism and extremism, new forms of cyberbullying emerge, more specifically cyberhate. The Internet has become a privileged tool to disseminate hatred, based on racism, xenophobia, bigotry, and islamophobia. Organized groups use the internet as a dissemination tool for their ideas, to build collective identity and to recruit young people. The presence of these groups has been facilitated worldwide thanks to technology. Yet, little attention has been granted to the way the Internet eases the activities of individuals who promote and propagate hate online. The role they play in spreading racism, xenophobia and bigotry is paramount as they regularly comment online about news and events, interacting with like-minded people with impunity because the web prevents people from being easily identified or controlled. While literature on exposure to hateful contents and cyberhate victimization is growing, little is known about who the perpetrators really are. A survey with young people aged 12-20 (N = 1,889) was completed in France and forms the basis of this article. It provides an understanding of the characteristics and associated variables of cyberhate perpetration. The Structural Equation model shows that cyberhate perpetration is heavily related to time spent online, victimization, belonging to a deviant youth group, positive attitudes toward violence and racism. Results from the SEM further suggest that people who suffered from online victimization will themselves have a greater tendency to belong to deviant youth groups. Multiple mediation analysis further suggests that trust in institutions may however prevent young people from belonging to a deviant youth group and decrease positive attitudes toward violence, thus diminishing the tendency to perform hateful aggression.

AB In this chapter, the authors examine the trajectory of the literature on race, culture, and identity in education research through the past century. The literature is first situated within its historical and conceptual foundations, specifically the dehumanizing legacy of scientific racism, the early efforts by African American scholars to rehumanize marginalized members of society, and the emergence of identity as a construct in the social sciences. The authors then explore the body of education research- from the mid 20th century to today-focused on the relationship between cultural and racial identities and students' experiences with schooling. They close with a vision for the next era of research on this critical topic.

AB Although African American educators strive to ameliorate racist and/or sexist barriers to learners' science engagement in U.S. education, examples of applications of culturally relevant science instruments to measure African American learners' engagement in science are hard to find in the literature. Inaccurate perceptions about student engagement in science education continue to exist, including assumptions about the prevalence and effects of low socioeconomic status, limited content knowledge, and a lack of interest or motivation of African American learners compared to white learners. Most exemplars of student engagement in science focus on the cognitive, behavioral, and social mores of white, male, cisgender, middle-class learners and their reactions to teacher pedagogy. This article reports on a qualitative study of three African American female and male secondary science educators' narratives of "engagement" in science amongst systemic inequities in the northeastern and southeastern U.S. regions. To better understand African American learners' science engagement, I combined socially transformative science curriculum approaches for African American students using five types of mastery with the concepts of culturally relevant science pedagogy as the facilitator of racial equity. A critical-arts-based research methodology was used to craft participants' autobiographical data and drawings into a literary metissage of the participants' experiences, memories, and culturally relevant pedagogical strategies. Themes included: (1) teachers' recognition that their interest and positionality impacted their engagement in science; (2) their understanding of how identifying as scientists informed their career choices and modes of participation; and (3) their observations about how mentoring and vision influenced students' attitudes about engaging in science. The major finding was that critical incidents that teachers experienced when they were students in K-20 schools influenced how they became engaged in science and constructed their culturally relevant practices as science educators. The implications of this finding for pre-service and teacher leadership development for equitable teaching and learning will be discussed, and recommendations for using culturally relevant science practices and navigating power dynamics will be provided.

ID SEXUAL VIOLENCE; RESPONSES
AB As feminist and anti-racist scholars and activists have long known, which stories predominate and which are marginalised is always a question of power and authority - about who is entitled to speak, and who has the authority to decide the meanings of words and actions. Storytelling can be used as a tool for social justice, as exemplified by the international feminist movement Hollaback! and its regional and worldwide struggle to end street harassment and make public spaces accessible for everyone. This article examines the practice of sharing stories within one specific Hollaback! group, highlighting the timeliness of the online storytelling technologies promoted by the movement and considering this work as an example of extra-academic feminist education. The article concludes by questioning to what extent feminists manage to formulate their own localised struggles through storytelling within the feminist movement as a whole.

AB In an ideal world, academia serves society; it provides quality education to future leaders and informs public policy-and it does so by including a diverse array of scholars. However, research and recent protest movements show that academia is subject to race-based inequities that hamper the recruitment and retention of scholars of color, reducing scientific impact. This article provides critical systemic context for racism in academia before reviewing research on psychological, interpersonal, and structural challenges to reducing racial inequality. Policy challenges include (a) the cultivation of harmful stereotypes, (b) the education of racially ignorant future leaders, and (c) the dedication of resources to science that informs only a few, rather than many. Finally, recommendations specify critical features of hiring, retention, transparency, and incentives that can diversify academia, create a more welcoming environment to scholars of color, and maximize the potential for innovative and impactful science.

AB This paper calls for a critical reimagination of science epistemology and praxis by advocating for a move toward Black liberation in and through K-12 science education. This call is driven by our desires as authors to foster a future of K-12 science teaching and learning that centers, embraces, and promotes historical and contemporary Black scientific innovation and creativity through practices that redress structural anti-Black racism and its implications on Black existence and life. Black Liberatory K-12 Science Education (BLKSE) names the existing challenges with cultivating and empowering Black minds in and through science as a result of anti-Black ideologies that ground and govern K-12 science access, teaching and learning. In naming said challenges as the manifestations of anti-Black ideologies, we shed light on the roles of K-12 science teachers and science teacher education regarding the treatment of Black students given oppressive policies and practices that fail to recognize Black brilliance and innovation. By advocating for a push toward BLKSE, we offer guiding concepts we feel are necessary to begin the process of rooting out anti-Blackness; a process that centers a holistic, heterogenous form of Blackness at the crux of science inquiry and understanding. As a result of this perspective, BLKSE embraces the beauty and creativity of Black youth, naming their positions and ideas as forms of scientific knowledge and inquiry, while disrupting existing mainstream paradigms and practices in science education. Implications for ways to work toward BLKSE in K-12 science teaching and teacher education are provided.

AB This study seeks to critically examine perceptions of urban school climate from a predominantly white teacher workforce and discuss the role that white identity, as the Dominant culture, plays in maintaining the status quo of racialized school climate. Participants included 145 teachers from a large southwestern urban setting. Teachers' perceptions were measured by the Teacher Perceptions of Urban School Climate survey that includes six dimensions that are important aspects of urban school climate: (1) Leadership, Relationality, and Care, (2) Perceptions of Security and Safety, (3) Student Belonging, (4) Constructivist Teacher Practice, (5) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and (6) Educator Retention. Results indicate that elementary school teachers had more positive perceptions of urban school climate and beginning teachers were less positive about aspects of urban school climate. Implications stemming from the results are discussed including the role whiteness and racism play in teacher perceptions of urban school climate and teacher education.

AB Recent events reveal the impact of systemic inequities on marginalized communities and highlight the importance of critical frameworks in science teacher education. Education theorists and research suggest that lack of sociopolitical, or critical, consciousness among teachers limits their ability to engage students in culturally relevant teaching and learning; provoking critical consciousness among white educators is an especially daunting task. Research is needed to uncover how science teacher educators might support the development of critical consciousness among practicing science teachers. In this article, we present findings from a study situated within a larger Design-based Research project to test and revise an instructional sequence grounded in science content, collaborative inquiry, and critical place-based pedagogies. This analysis of how participants' collective awareness developed over the course of a four-day Professional Development workshop offers insight into how innovative in-service science teacher education might be employed to support practitioners' understanding of oppressive systems including those inherent in the discipline of science. Findings suggest that the incorporation of collaborative inquiry as a design heuristic supported teachers' emerging understanding of the role inequitable systems play in disparate health outcomes. In addition, interrogating race and racism in the context of science challenged deficit frameworks and prompted some participants to acknowledge the limitations of their own lived experiences in comparison with those of their students. Implications include a new model for professional development to support practicing teachers' moves toward justice-oriented science teaching and learning.

TI HIV risk and prevention among Asian/Pacific islander men who have sex
   with men: Listen to our stories
SO AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN; BISEXUAL MEN; PACIFIC; GAY; COMMUNITY; AIDS
AB Despite increasing need for HIV prevention research and intervention programs, the voices and stories of Asian and Pacific Islander men who have sex with men (API MSM) have remained absent from HIV prevention literature. Five focus groups with API MSM (N = 38) were conducted to identify psychological, social, and cultural factors related to HIV risk and protection. Six themes were identified based on focus group discussion: (a) dual-identity status, (b) coming out and disclosure issues, (c) relationships and dating, (d) substance use, (e) sexual risk reduction strategies, and (f) health and social services. Narrative data indicate that multilevel HIV prevention intervention strategies are necessary for addressing the unique psychosocial and behavioral HIV risk factors among API MSM, such as dual stigma stemming from homophobia and racism, discomfort with sexuality, power dynamics and stereotypes in relationships with White men, substance use, and low utilization of health and social services.

TI Why Biologists & Biology Teachers Are Uniquely Qualified to Discuss the
   Issue of Biological Race
SO AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
DE biological race; racism; antiracism; human evolution; pseudo-science;
   social construct
AB The damaging outcomes of racist ideologies continue to influence all aspects of society. This in spite of the fact that at their core these ideologies rely on a fundamentally false assumption: that biologically there are different races among humans. The source of this fallacy is pseudoscience and historical prejudice, and yet even scientists and medical professionals continue to apply misconceptions about biological race when performing research or practicing medicine. Scientific educators are in a unique position to dismantle the central damaging assumption, and here we provide a straightforward approach that educators can employ for engaging in this conversation. It is organized around four questions that build sequentially and integrate the latest science with a history of the topic: How did the myth of biological subcategories of humans become ingrained as a scientific concept? How has scientists' approach to taxonomy changed since Linnaeus's first human classifications? What does biology now tell us about variation within the human species? Why is it critical to debunk this myth? We provide answers with which scientific educators can re-center the conversation around historical and scientific facts, while highlighting how misapplication of the evidence harms the integrity of science as a field.

   IMPUTATION; BELIEFS
AB The American Physical Society calls on its members to improve the diversity of physics by supporting an inclusive culture that encourages women and Black, Indigenous, and people of color to become physicists. In the current educational system, it is unlikely for a student to become a physicist if they do not share the same attitudes about what it means to learn and do physics as those held by most professional physicists. Evidence shows college physics courses and degree programs do not support students in developing these attitudes. Rather physics education filters out students who do not enter college physics courses with these attitudes. To better understand the role of attitudes in the lack of diversity in physics, we investigated the intersecting relationships between racism and sexism in inequities in student attitudes about learning and doing physics using a critical quantitative framework. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine students' attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes database and included 2170 students in 46 calculus-based mechanics courses and 2503 students in 49 algebra-based mechanics courses taught at 18 institutions. Like prior studies, we found that attitudes either did not change or slightly decreased for most groups. Results identified large differences across intersecting race and gender groups representing educational debts society owes these students. White students, particularly White men in calculus-based courses, tended to have more expertlike attitudes than any other group of students. Instruction that addresses society's educational debts can help move physics toward an inclusive culture supportive of diverse students and professionals.

AB In this conceptual essay, the authors draw on their partnerships with schools to articulate radical belonging as a guiding vision for antiracist learning communities, centering students of color in particular. They distinguish radical belonging from common conceptions of school belonging in several ways. First, they emphasize that radical belonging requires transformative change to root out the racism endemic to schooling in the United States. Second, they focus on the school community as a key unit of change, highlighting that radical belonging is a communal experience that stems from collective action. Third, they delineate three essential, interconnected aspects of radical belonging: social belonging, or an ethos of critical care; academic belonging, involving learning that is agentic, culturally and linguistically responsive, collaborative, and anti-hierarchical; and democratic belonging, which engages students, families, and educators in collaboratively developing shared understandings of, and resistance to, white supremacy and interlocking systems of oppression.

AB Reading teachers and teacher educators are the latest to blame in public discourse for reading failure in the United States. In March 2019, Pearson Education released the draft of the Science of Teaching Reading Examination Framework for Texas, and the state's teachers and teacher educators were called on to revise courses and programs in alignment. In this article, the authors provide an overview of the narratives drawn on to position teachers and teacher educators as struggling and the partiality of these narratives from our perspective as both professionally responsible and anti-racist educators. The authors present three counterstories that exhibit how teachers and teacher educators are exceeding the expectations of the framework by foregrounding more complex, social justice-focused perspectives on readers and reading. The authors argue for the inclusion of professionals using anti-oppressive and contextualized professional knowledge and practices to move the field forward.

AB The literature depicting educators' role in scientific racism and eugenics during the early 20th century has tended to approach the topic in dichotomous terms, as an ideology that one was either for or against. In this historical study, the author adds some nuance to this literature by tracing leading educators' inconsistent and evolving thoughts on eugenics and the 'science' of race. By approaching the educational discourse on race as thinking rather than thought, the author explores how scholars such as G. Stanley Hall, John Dewey, Franz Boas, William Bagley, David Snedden, Edward Thorndike and Charles Ellwood struggled to make sense of a rapidly changing ideological landscape, but nevertheless supported the ideology of white supremacy.

AB Social work research has adopted the scientific method rooted in the hard sciences as the gold standard for understanding human behavior and creating interventions and policies for both individual and systemic change. Current methodologies are rooted in White supremacy that lack the subjectivity needed to provide space for the effects of racism and oppression to be included in studies and evidence-based practice. Social work cannot be antiracist and anti-oppressive unless it creates an inclusive research methods class that is critical of what is considered scientific rigor. This teaching note presents the current evolution of a social work research methods class to promote critical thinking around what is believed to be the gold standard of scientific research.

ID PERSPECTIVES
AB This study examines the development of literacy and identity for young Indigenous Taiwanese children using ethnographic methods and the theories of multiple literacies, Indigenous knowledge, and identity construction, and it provides insights into the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge and literacies to create hybrid literacy spaces. Focused-upon participants included four 6-year-old Rukai-tribe children-two who lived in a city and two who lived in a village-and their families and teachers. We found that all children learned literacies in culturally meaningful contexts that involved stories and hybrid literacy practices, Indigenous foods, religious activities, traditional life skills, Indigenous language, and multiple forms of text. The two city children developed Rukai knowledge and literacies through performance-based contexts, whereas the village children learned through authentic contexts (e.g., observing farming and hunting). The literacy and identity of the two city children may be undermined due to limited access to Rukai resources, stemming from racism, classism, and linguicism.

AB Overrepresentation of students of color with and without dis/abilities in exclusionary practices (e.g., suspension, expulsion) is a historically accumulating educational debt that stems from the intersection of racism, ableism, and other forms of oppression. As a historical, sociopolitical, and geospatial situated issue, addressing racial disproportionality in exclusionary practices requires developing localized solutions in response to local racial politics and the school community's needs and goals. In an effort to develop localized solutions to racial disproportionality in exclusionary practices, the Learning Lab was implemented at an urban Middle School in the 2021-2022 academic year. The Learning Lab is a community-driven systemic design process in which local stakeholders engage in systemic analysis of the existing system and collaboratively design a new schoolwide support system. This study investigated how school stakeholders designed a culturally sustaining and inclusive support system to address the overrepresentation of students of color with and without dis/abilities in exclusionary practices.

AB U.S. Latinx youth from immigrant backgrounds bring to schools their transnational literacies, complex lived experiences of marginalization and resistance, and politicized translanguaging practices that are seldom recognized in classrooms. This article examines U.S. Latinx bilingual youth who participated in a podcast project within a Chicanx/Latinx Studies high school course that mobilized their bilingualism for literacy instruction. This ethnographic classroom study explores a curricular unit that allowed young people to use new media technologies to tell important stories of themselves and their social worlds at a time of heightened anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States. Through translanguaging and translingual frames, I demonstrate how Latinx young people contest racist narratives, reclaim who they are, and author new spaces for solidarity. Findings detail the ways that students utilized podcasts as a tool to promote creativity and self-expression, and to connect personal experiences to broader pressing discourses about immigration, language, racialization processes, and resistance.

AB This study explores the circumstances of Kurdish refugee youth in Canada. Using a critical ethnographic approach, I interviewed twenty young people, aged 15-30, to examine their transnational identities and lived experiences in the Canadian context. Arendt's notion of the right to have rights, Isin's concept of acts of citizenship, and Hall's concept of state hegemony proved to be useful theoretical tools to examine the exclusion of refugee youth from the educational market and their statelessness, rightlessness, and statuslessness in the nation-states. The interview data indicate that the statelessness and statuslessness of refugee youth stem from the practices of hegemony, assimilation, and racism by their home and host state. The study also suggests the importance of questioning the state's hegemony and the domination of the western construction of citizenship to provide alternative forms of social and educational participation that can transform the youths' status from refugees to actors and citizens.

AB In the twenty-first century, the rise and support of fascism-related views threaten freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, religious tolerance and progressive agendas that advocate equity. We argue that mainstream science education generally does not, but should, educate students against fascism-related views-such as racism, sexism, homophobia and religious intolerance-with a view to strengthening mutual respect and the common good. We argue some science teaching practices are found to be suitable to fascism-like ideologies (e.g. race in genetics teaching), and that the use of the concept of 'scientific literacy' has focused on neoliberal possessive individualism. As a consequence, mainstream science education overlooks the development of sympathy, altruism and interpersonal skills. We also discuss the activity of science education in authoritarian, undemocratic regimes in history, showing that fascist regimes have long used 'apolitical' scientists' achievements to establish and expand regimes' intolerant and violent ideologies. We use that historical relationship to argue fascism is science education's business. Given the fear that current political discourses in many countries are again swinging towards fascism, we outline potential pathways for science education which focus on the social and emotional development of students. We argue that to develop a pedagogy for democracy, that attends to equity and social justice, it is imperative it enables pupils to develop at a psychological level with diverse others, including through their own agency. This pedagogy builds on critical pedagogies.

TI Influence of African American engineering student perceptions of campus
   climate on graduation rates
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE African American; retention; graduation rate
AB African American undergraduate engineering student perceptions of institutional and personal/social campus climate factors were investigated to determine how these perceptions influence academic performance and institutional graduation rates. Data collection was accomplished through use of a quantitative and qualitative survey instrument administered to a national sample of subjects. The research discovered wide variation in individual institutional African American graduation rates and differences in rates among groups of institutions categorized by their academic selectivity or their designation as a Historically Black College and University. Students at institutions in the higher of the academic selectivity categories had higher graduation rates. However, students enrolled in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities category had more favorable perceptions of their college experience and had higher grades than students attending other institutions. After controlling for institution category, higher graduation rates were associated with students' lower perceptions of racism and discrimination and with students' greater institutional commitment.

DT Article
DE What's hot; literacy; science of reading; dyslexia; phonemic awareness;
   social justice
AB The annual What's Hot in Literacy survey uncovers the current focal points within literacy education. A panel of twenty-five literacy leaders participated and engaged in interviews to identify the most and least emphasized literacy topics, as well as those deserving more attention. The findings for 2023 spotlight several topics categorized as "very hot," including dyslexia and other specific learning disabilities, early literacy, phonics/phonemic awareness, and social justice/equity/anti-racism in literacy. The topics of the science of reading and structured literacy emerged as "extremely hot," and the sole topic ranked as "should not be hot" for the 2023 survey cycle. Assessing these outcomes and their potential impacts on literacy education holds importance for educators across all levels.

TI "DO YOU FEEL ME?" Affectively and Effectively Engaging Racial
   Pedagogical Content Knowledge in Social Studies Classrooms
SO RACE LESSONS: USING INQUIRY TO TEACH ABOUT RACE IN SOCIAL STUDIES
SE Teaching and Learning Social Studies
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB This chapter discusses the key tenets of racial pedagogical content knowledge (RPCK; Chandler, 2015) and how teachers can affectively and effectively develop and engage RPCK in social studies classrooms. In addition to the development of content and pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986), Chandler proposes that teachers must also develop a "working racial knowledge of how race operates within social science, from CRT [critical race theory] perspectives" (Chandler, 2015, p. 5). This chapter thus has three aims: (a) to situate the urgent need for RPCK within the racialized contexts of social studies curriculum, classrooms, and schools; (b) to re-imagine some of the inevitable and necessary emotions (i.e., stress, anxiety, fear, pain, etc.) that often accompany efforts to authentically engage issues of race and racism in social studies classrooms as moments of radical possibilities to expand and develop one's RPCK (Matias, 2014; Matias, 2016; Stevenson, 2014), as well as an informed empathy for students (Ladson-Billings, 2006); and (c) to discuss the prospects of engaging RPCK in social studies classrooms as a courageous move towards radical healing (Ginwright, 2010; Ginwright, 2015). The chapter concludes with a call to social studies educators to conceptualize RPCK as framework that is less about trying to "learn it all" when it comes to race and more about a commitment to an audacious (not to be confused with fearless) approach to social studies teaching and learning about issues of race and racism.

AB To promote a justice-oriented approach to science education, we formed a research-practice partnership between middle school science teachers, their students, curriculum designers, learning scientists, and experts in social justice to co-design and test an environmental justice unit for middle school instruction. We examine teacher perspectives on the challenges and possibilities of integrating social justice into their standards-aligned science teaching as they participate in co-design and teach the unit. The unit supports students to investigate racially disparate rates of asthma in their community by examining pollution maps and historical redlining maps. We analyze interviews and co-design artifacts from two teachers who participated in the co-design and taught the unit in their classrooms. Our findings point to the benefits of a shared pedagogical framework and an initial unit featuring local historical content to structure co-design. Findings also reveal that teachers can share similar goals for empowering students to use science knowledge for civic action while framing the local socio-political factors contributing to the injustice differently, due in part to different institutional supports and constraints. Student interviews and a pre/postassessment illustrate how the unit facilitated students' progress in connecting socio-political and science ideas to explain the impacts of particulate matter pollution and who is impacted most. Analyses illuminate how teachers' pedagogical choices may influence whether and how students discuss the impact of systemic racism in their explanations. The findings inform refinement of the unit and suggest supports needed for co-design partnerships focused on integrating social justice and science.

TI Critical Online Service-Learning Pedagogy: Justice in Science Education
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TUSKEGEE; GAPS; RACE
AB In the year 2020 the world changed dramatically. We went from busy lives spent largely away from home to spending most of our time at home while daily facing deepening national crises. With the violent, needless death of George Floyd, the simmering tensions around race in America boiled over, sending thousands into the streets to protest racial injustices. The world of science education has largely avoided discussing racism in our classes, but we can no longer ignore it. The events of the spring and summer have highlighted our need to integrate conversations and reflections on justice into science education. In this work we argue that service learning can build this understanding from both theory and experience. Utilizing a critical online service-learning framework, we have developed a service-learning course that incorporates dialogic communication, cross-contextual reflections, and positioning oneself as an ally. This perspective allows science and the community to prioritize relationships, humanity, and reflect on our roles as professionals, utilizing the online interacting space. This course, taught at the beginning of the pandemic, focuses on critical online service learning for those studying public health. We discuss the challenges we faced moving critical service-learning pedagogy online, and the compounding issues brought on by the pandemic itself.

FX We thank our associated centers and team members for all the work they
   have done to ensure that this course was realized. This work is a
   collaboration between the SOURCE Community Engagement and
   Service-Learning Center led by Mindi Levin, the R<SUP>3</SUP> Center for
   Innovation in Science Education (R<SUP>3</SUP>ISE) led by Gundula Bosch,
   PhD, and the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) at the Johns Hopkins
   Bloomberg School of Public Health. We thank program directors Mindi and
   Gundula who played an integral role in the development of this course.
   This course innately relies on online technologies and therefore its
   development depended upon the assistance of CTL instructional design
   manager Kathy Gresh and senior instructional designer Mia Lamm. Without
   Kathy and Mia and the rest of the CTL team we would not have been able
   to develop the technologies for this course including the videos and
   podcast-like conversations. We also need to thank our teaching assistant
   Elise whose dedication, time, and attention helped our students feel
   included and added to the success of this course. All members of our
   team, Mindi, Gundula, Elise, Kathy, and Mia, were invaluable to the
   process, without their hard work this would not be the dynamic and
   engaging course we are proud to have produced. Service learning
   intrinsically requires community partners, and we are so thankful for
   ours. Alex and Melodie were true collaborators, bringing their time and
   expertise to this course. Without their passion and insights this course
   would not exist. Finally, we also thank the JHU Provost's Office for
   funding this work through the Digital Education and Learning Technology
   Acceleration (DELTA) Grant and The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
   Institutional Review Board for IRB approval. The authors have no
   conflicts of interest to declare.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID RACIAL-ATTITUDES; COLOR; WHITENESS; STUDENTS; BIAS; AGE
AB The online classroom introduces a sense of anonymity unlike that in the physical classroom. In some ways, online education seems as if it could be more equitable or even free from racism because physical characteristics are mostly absent from which racialized judgments are made. However, students' feelings about how technology afforded anonymity do not always indicate online education is free of identity bias or racialization. This mixed-methods study investigates students' feelings (n = 174) about fair grading practices and anonymity in undergraduate online classes. Findings suggest that online students perceive anonymity, and their identities factor into grading, in both positive and negative ways. Rubrics and clear expectations can help alleviate concern over unfair grading practices. Institutions intent on offering online instruction should not rely on students' perceptions of anonymity to create equitable learning environments.

AB Education reform in the United States has unwisely focused attention on standards and accountability to the state as determined by standardized testing (Berliner & Biddle, 1995; Mehta, 2013). Stemming from the emphasis on standards-based accountability are the ideas of rapid school turnaround and the state's role in this process (Peck & Reitzug, 2014; VanGronigen & Meyers, 2019). The current study employed critical policy discourse analysis to examine the media's portrayal of the 2019 determination to continue or terminate state control of the Little Rock School District. The analysis highlights two argumentative frames-one that emphasized neoliberal values in support of continued state control of the district and another that focused on systemic racism as the basis for advocating for local control of the district. These frames, along with their implications for future actions within the educational policy making process, guide the discussion. Our findings suggest sustained community and media participation is needed to bring attention to education policy issues while underscoring the importance of taking a critical stance to assess media coverage.

ID EXPERIENCES
AB Objective. In the wake of several high-profile police killings, in 2020 the United States began another reckoning with structural racism, injustice, and violence against Black Americans. The objectives of this study were to explore the impact of racialized sociopolitical events on Black Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students. Methods. Focus groups were conducted with second-to fourth-year Black PharmD students enrolled at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy. The focus groups were conducted in summer 2020, beginning two months after the murder of George Floyd and concluding before the start of the fall semester. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological approach, and themes were identified using inductive coding. Results. Twenty-four participants were recruited into five focus group sessions. Thematic analysis of the transcripts resulted in three distinct themes related to the study objectives: Vicarious Trauma, Hypervigilance, and Fight or Flight Responses. Black students reported that they experienced significant psychological distress as a result of prominent racially traumatic events. Some Black students reported withdrawing from non-Black persons due to hypersensitivity and anxiety while others were willing to engage in candid conversations. Conclusion. Racial trauma has implications for student wellness and academic success. As racism and police brutality have proven to be an ever-present problem, this study offers key information for consideration as institutions recruit, support, and retain diverse learners. The data may also inform educators and pharmacy students regarding interactions with Black patients, coworkers, and health professionals during times of sociopolitical unrest.

TI Understanding the Emotional Labor of English Language Teaching while
   Black in the United States
SO TESOL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; TEACHERS; RACE; EXPERIENCES
AB There is a robust literature examining emotional labor as it is experienced by English language teachers and how it is prompted by the emotional rules of their employers. However, it has not been sufficiently inclusive of native English-speaking Black English language teachers (BELTs). Using the method of autoethnography I examine my experiences with emotional labor as I struggle to manage feelings stemming from race-related stress to present feelings that are aligned with the emotional rules of an intensive English program (IEP) in the United States. Ultimately, this study highlights some of the unique challenges and emotional labor experienced by BELTs, including the endured triggering of race-related stress in response to workplace racial microaggression and how and why, through the process of emotional labor, outward responses are constructed. I argue that enduring emotional labor brings about implicit oppressive messages for BELTs to either detach from their racial identity to some extent or to leave their field. Additionally, I provide suggestions for how TESOL programs housed in U.S. higher education contexts can address anti-Black racism.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of Black doctoral students in music education in terms of their motivations to pursue doctoral studies, educational and social experiences while enrolled, and emerging information literacy. Qualitative techniques based on phenomenology were employed to document and better understand the experience of a small, purposive sample of Black doctoral students (n = 14) enrolled at universities throughout the United States. A variety of techniques ensured trustworthiness, including data triangulation, member checking, and use of an external interviewer. After data analysis, four core essences emerged: (a) Familial support and formative experiences during childhood, (b) Overload of information and frustration in conducting research, (c) Prejudice and lack of Black representation in the academy, and (d) Change-oriented motivations beset by barriers to access. Findings revealed commonalities in participants' lived experiences that could inform efforts to recruit and retain Black doctoral students, develop curricula that takes into account their experiences and goals, stem systemic racism, and promote equity and inclusion in the academy.

AB Using discourse analysis, this article traces the persistence of eugenic ideology through the narrative structures of world history in the California Department of Education's history/social science K-12 framework. This article excavates the hidden depths at which scientific racism has become embedded into the curriculum and asks, "How do eugenic beliefs continue to shape world history in schools?" Analysis revealed the persistence of eugenic beliefs in how civilization, modernity, reason, and intelligence are articulated and circulated across grades six, seven and ten. This study's application of discourse analysis serves as a useful tool in continuing to improve curricular frameworks beyond static narratives that reproduce outdated ideologies of race and human development. The study directs social studies education toward helping students confront history's scientific overlaps with eugenics, as well as recognizing how eugenic ideology persists today.

TI White Women's Affect: Niceness, Comfort, and Neutrality as Cover for
   Racial Harm
SO JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RACE
AB This critical narrative inquiry explored how white women's racialized emotions are structured by whiteness as a technology of affect (Leonardo & Zembylas, 2013) and connected to particular col-lege experiences. Specifically, white women college students used claims of niceness and demands for emotional comfort as cover for racial harm, while anger with racism and frustration with their own white complicity (Applebaum, 2010) signaled an ability to tarry with white complicity and moti-vated actions in solidarity with people of color. Pedagogies of both discomfort and white complicity suggest ways to center marginalized and vulner-able communities while engaging white students in confronting white supremacy and its affective roots. These pedagogical approaches have impli-cations for curricular and cocurricular education across and beyond higher education. Findings also suggested that theories of student development must account for the insidious nature of whiteness under white supremacy.

AB This study describes the experiences of two preservice science teachers as they progress through their respective teacher education programs and uses critical race theory to examine the manner in which conceptions about race and its pedagogical implications change over time. Using a longitudinal case study method, participants' conceptual ecologies of race and pedagogy are mapped both before and after student teaching, and each case is analyzed for evidence of conceptual change in these areas. Findings show that conceptions about race and the pedagogical implications of race changed in ways that likely would have gone undetected in earlier studies because they did not result in wholesale changes in beliefs or teaching practice. This study suggests that the difficulty of fostering an understanding of structural racism and difference may often be underestimated, as revising one's model about race is mitigated strongly by learners' existing conceptual ecologies.

AB The racial and ethnic makeup of the United States is in constant flux and is expected to experience substantial increases in racial and ethnic diversity over the next four decades. The problem the American educational system faces is attempting to problematize race/racism in its educational system and creating a system to counteract educational impartialities present for children of color. The disparity we face grows as teacher education programs graduate primarily White female teacher candidates, who express trepidations teaching students of color. In this article, we explore specific influences, confines, and conflicts that exist in urban schools, as a starting point to converse about the issues of race in science education and establish a strong theoretical rationale for the continued investigation of a race-based analysis of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP). Finally, we propose a more inclusive model for teacher preparation programs that embrace and encourage critical conversations about race.

TI Structural Competence and Equity-Minded Interprofessional Education: A
   Common Reading Approach to Learning

AB As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement, leaders in the field of interprofessional (IP) education have encouraged faculty to explore online adaptations to curriculum and examine strategies that enhance students' structural competence. Structural competence is broadly defined as the ability to understand how oppression, governmental policies, and environmental inputs impact the health and well-being of an individual. With these changes in mind, a team of IP health science faculty developed two online curricular activities guided by the "common reading" book, Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital by Sheri Fink. This article describes the development and findings of a mixed-methods evaluation of the two IP learning activities: (a) The Interprofessional Common Reading Experience (IPCRE) and (b) The IPCRE follow-up. The activities engaged over 250 students across multiple health professions (i.e., social work, nursing, athletic training, speech-language pathology, nutrition, and public health) attending three different universities. Our findings contribute to a greater understanding of how to develop online IP activities and curricular innovations that help to train equity-minded and anti-racist practitioners.

AB Teaching and learning relies on age-appropriate, credible formal (e.g., textbooks, textbook supplements) and informal (e.g., trade-books) curricular texts. Previous research traced American publishers' self-censorship about human evolution within twentieth-century textbooks. This study, informed by the latest scientific understandings, engaged in content analysis of scientific depictions of evolution, race, (homo)sexuality, and intersex identity. The data pool contained American biology textbooks, trade-books, and curricular supplements published after 1990 (n = 153). Findings revealed age-appropriate, comprehensive evolutionary depictions, yet stark omissions of scientific evidence and arguments challenging white supremacy, cisheteronormativity, and pathologization of racialized, queer, and intersex identities. Most modern biology curricular texts, in other words, disregard scientific examination of the tenets grounding racism, homophobia, and transphobia. Why do most biology curricular resources omit the science controverting prominent pseudoscientific fears? Who determines what is taught? The consequences of curricular omissions are particularly alarming considering the violence and violent threats targeting already-marginalized people.

AB Teacher education is polarized. Traditionalists tend to center core practices, while justice-oriented scholars center ideologies embedded within our practices. Both, however, must consider how practices and ideologies can operate interdependently to disrupt inequity and cultivate agency among all students. Drawing on an intersectionally-aligned theory, DisCrit, we argue that practices andthe ideologies they embody can be problematized vis-a-vis how racism and ableism operate to support hegemony bound in, and represented by, the normative center of schooling. In this paper, we unpack what DisCrit affords critical teacher education, how individuals with complex support needs are located within DisCrit's tenets, if at all, and the application of DisCrit in the disciplinary case of science education. By considering possibilities not yet explored within the literature, we further critical conversations about the relationship between DisCrit, silenced perspectives of populations unaddressed in teacher education for equity, and new disciplinary possibilities of what we mean by justice-oriented applications of theory and practice.

TI EDUCATING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE IN A POST-DIGITAL ERA
SO REVISTA PRAXIS EDUCACIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Education; Social Justice; Post-digital era
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; TEACHER-EDUCATION; MATHEMATICS
AB This article focuses on education for social justice in a post-digital area. Nowadays, common sentiments of disenchantment and skepticism with technology are expressed by teachers' choices of using or foregoing advanced technologies in their classrooms, either because they do not have access to them or because they are not properly taught (nor even trained) to use them. On the side of the students, post-truth, misinformation and disinformation have been blurring the way that contents and their relationship with the world should be considered. We define education for social justice, given the significant and substantial studies in the field (FREIRE, 1974/2010; MCDONALD, 2005, 2007, MCDONALD & ZEICHNER, 2009; LEONARD ET AL, 2010; AGARVAL ET AL, 2010; DE OLIVEIRA, 2013). We also deepen conceptions that we consider to be essential for confronting problems of the post-digital era: (i) attention to neoliberalism and its impacts on education for social justice (HURSH, 2005; COCHRAN-SMITH ET AL, 2009; SLEETER, 2009; MILNER, 2010); (ii) attention to race, racism, and a claim for anti-oppressive education (LADSON-BILLINGS & TATE, 1995; KUMASHIRO, 2000, 2001; BANKS, 2001; RICHERT ET AL, 2009; YOUNG, 2010; SLEETER, 2017). Our conclusions are geared towards the post-digital era, when access to data and the latest technology remains limited to those in positions of power. Teacher and teacher educators should strive to create environments which encourage exposure to perspectives that are inclusive of marginalized groups and allow for further understanding of a variety of ethnicities, cultures, socioeconomical backgrounds, and sexual orientations.

AB The focus on identity in the field of teaching and learning continues to grow, especially when it concerns equitable outcomes for students. While most attention is placed on students' identities and increasingly those of teachers, lesser addressed are the identities of the teacher educators and researchers broaching the issue of identity. Additionally, identity research is not often linked to relationships between self, others, and transformative action. We recognize these as gaps to be addressed and offer critical positional praxis (CPP) as a response. CPP is the public manifestation of the insights gained through our sense of identity and reflexivity. More specifically, CPP is the actions (or inactions) that express who we are in response to an event in any given social context-especially oppressive ones. In this article, we draw from our own critical autoethnographies, as a context for putting CPP into practice in identity research. Our collective analysis of these critical autoethnographies revealed how our identity development was inseparable from the ways in which we have each resisted the politics of domestication. Our autoethnographies further point to the role of dissent as central to our experiences of becoming critical science teacher educators committed to equity, diversity, and anti-racism in education. We draw from this analysis to offer recommendations for how identity and positionality can move beyond theoretical constructs toward transformative personal and collective change in science education.

DT Article
DE Literature; Writings-experiences; Experience
AB This article shares my assumption of theoretical-methodological paths in which I choose to move away from traditional and positivist ways of doing research in which knowledge to be legitimized needs to be measured, quantified and validated by a modern contemporary, racist and hegemonic science that excludes black peoples from the process of knowledge production (ROSA, BRITO; PINHEIRO, 2020) to approach me in a way(s) to research that welcomes a first person written research, where my writing is articulated with the experiences lived by me as a black woman and a teacher of early childhood education in the shanty town. For this, I use the writings-experiences (EVARISTO, 2020) as a methodological tool and as a possibility to narrate the lived (LIMA; GERALDI; GERALDI, 2015), evoking daily experiences in a discourse that is enunciated from within my own reality. In the text, I defend literature as a possibility to enhance the construction of identities, the strengthening and appreciation of black belonging in which narratives promote the enchantment and discovery of the beauty of being black and the denunciation of the subaltern condition that society insists on placing us as a woman and black, especially in the academic environment, where our voices are systematically silenced and the knowledge arising from experience is systematically refuted.

TI <i>Babylon by Bus?</i> The dispersal of immigrant children in England,

SO PAEDAGOGICA HISTORICA

DT Article
DE Dispersal/bussing; England; 1960s-1980s; immigrant children;
   integration; segregation; racism
AB The history of forced dispersal of immigrant children in England, which affected mostly non-Anglophone Asian pupils in areas such as Southall (West London) and Bradford (West Yorkshire) in the 1960s and 1970s has only very recently elicited the interest of historians. Mobilising archival material as well as interviews with formerly bussed pupils, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing debate on the education and integration of immigrant children in Britain. This it does by appraising dispersal policies from the point of view of State and bureaucratic simplifications wherein the Department of Education and Science urgently introduced some policies to assuage white fears of an immigrant takeover locally (Southall). It focuses on perceptions of "tax-payers rights", at the heart of white autochthonous appreciations of the education system itself but which was largely denied to immigrant parents. Lastly, it analyses the extent to which, for the bussed pupils, racism on the playground was a lived norm, before studying the way how memories of bussing have shaped the interviewees' identities in the long term.

AB Background Structural and interpersonal anti-Indigenous racism is prevalent in Canadian healthcare. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls on medical schools to address anti-Indigenous bias in students. We measured the prevalence of interpersonal anti-Indigenous bias among medical school applicants to understand how the medical school selection process selects for or against students with high levels of bias. Methods All applicants to a single university in the 2020-2021 admissions cycle were invited to participate. Explicit anti-Indigenous bias was measured using two sliding scale thermometers. The first asked how participants felt about Indigenous people (from 0, indicating 'cold/unfavourable' to 100, indicating 'warm/favourable') and the second asked whether participants preferred white (scored 100) or Indigenous people (scored 0). Participants then completed an implicit association test examining preferences for European or Indigenous faces (negative time latencies suggest preference for European faces). Explicit and implicit anti-Indigenous biases were compared by applicant demographics (including gender and racial identity), application status (offered an interview, offered admission, accepted a position), and compared to undergraduate medical and mathematics students. Results There were 595 applicant respondents (32.4% response rate, 64.2% cisgender women, 55.3% white). Applicants felt warmly toward Indigenous people (median 96 (IQR 80-100)), had no explicit preference for white or Indigenous people (median 50 (IQR 37-55), and had mild implicit preference for European faces (- 0.22 ms (IQR -0.54, 0.08 ms)). There were demographic differences associated with measures of explicit and implicit bias. Applicants who were offered admission had warmer feelings toward Indigenous people and greater preference for Indigenous people compared to those were not successful. Conclusions Medical school applicants did not have strong interpersonal explicit and implicit anti-Indigenous biases. Outlier participants with strong biases were not offered interviews or admission to medical school.

DE signification; polytechnism; concept; affect; freedom; height psychology
AB In recent years, Vygotsky's theory of the historical development from the 'primitive' through the 'cultural man' and on to the 'superhuman' has been subjected to keen criticism. In the concept of the primitive, colonialistic arrogance and even racism are discovered, and the concept of the superhuman is attributed to the influence of Nietzsche and Marxist revolutionary utopias. Vygotsky's criticism of the modern 'cultural man' is virtually ignored. This article reveals the actual content of these concepts in the theory of Vygotsky and clears them of the latest ideological connotations. The historical framework for the existence of the primitive man is defined as the following: from the start of labouring life to the invention of 'signification'. The era of the superhuman will come as a result of the 'polytechnization of labor', i.e., the transformation of labour into an applied science. The psychology of the future will become the 'theory and practice of the superhuman'. It aims to form a free, universally developed personality that creates the conditions of its own life and regulates its psychological functions.

AB This study explores the multicultural predispositions of 437 students in a Central Appalachian university. After selecting students from a wide range of majors, this article shows which sort of multicultural programs garner weaker and stronger support in this undergraduate population. Following this descriptive elaboration, a set of OLS regressions tests a wide range of competing explanatory prepositions. Some of the explanatory models draw from familiar demographic and university-effect variables. However, this article expands on the education literature by drawing from some sociological, psychological and political science studies of American reactions to other multicultural programs (i.e., Affirmative Action, school desegregation, and welfare reform). By adding the variables on symbolic racism, authoritarianism and beliefs in American meritocracy, the final mix of 21 independent variables produces a somewhat robust model. Moreover, this analysis also identifies which educational practices seem to encourage a greater appreciation of a multicultural learning process. Finally, we address issues of generalizing to a national population by comparing our findings to case studies of multicultural education at other universities.

AB Racialized narratives of academic ability, perpetuated by ahistorical interpretations of student performance data, have led to educational policies focusing on short-term solutions, instead of the ongoing legacies of racism and settler colonialism. The aim of this paper is to show how the racially defined achievement gap operates within the structure of settler colonialism. Informed by theories of settler colonialism (Tuck & Yang, 2012, Veracini, 2010) and critical race theory (Harris, 1993; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995), I closely examine some Toronto District School Board documents that address the so-called achievement and opportunity gaps. Using critical discourse analysis, this paper shows how the notion of achievement is racialized to protect white settler property rights, and how the discourse of achievement gaps functions as a settler technology to concurrently include and exclude individuals from the settler project. Understanding the settler colonial constructions of race brings to the foreground the relations between Indigenous erasure, anti-Blackness, and othering of racialized communities within the contemporary multicultural nation ( Haque, 2012; Tuck & Gorlewski, 2016).

AB Background/Context: The disparity between the race and ethnicity of teachers and students is expected to increase as our nation and classrooms continue to become more racially, ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse. It is extremely important to think about not only the educational needs of such a diverse student population within schools but also who will teach these students. However, when looking at subject-matter specificity for the retention of Teachers of Color, such as science teachers, the picture becomes extremely serious when we understand teachers' paths into and out of science and teaching.
   Purpose: The purpose of the study is to analyze the experiences of preservice Teachers of Color (PTOC) enrolled in an elementary science methods course as they gain access to science as White property. Our analysis provides evidence that PTOC can break the perpetual cycle of alienation, exclusion, and inequity in science when they are given opportunities to engage in science as learners and teachers. In addition, we also offer insights regarding the role science teacher educators may play in preparing teachers and especially TOC for urban schools.
   Setting/Research Design: The context of this study was a graduate-level preservice elementary science methods course at a large urban university in New York City. Multiple data sources included pre-post surveys, semester observation journals, final course papers, and a post-course questionnaire. Utilizing constructivist grounded during the initial phase of analysis and themes from critical race theory (CRT), our unique voices of color and positionalities allowed us to interpret the data from a CRT perspective and arrive at findings relevant to making science inclusive to PTOC.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: In order to push the field of science teacher education toward social justice issues of access, opportunity, and enjoyment, efforts must focus on increasing representation of Teachers of Color in science education. The transformation of science teacher education to grant equitable learning experiences for Teachers of Color is needed. Further research on the experiences of science Teachers of Color, as well as Faculty of Color and their relationship with students, is highly encouraged. Both teacher preparation and science education must be open to interrogate and reveal structural forms of race, racism, and power that manifest through curriculum, structure, and pedagogy that cause alienation and exclusion for Teachers of Color. Therefore, we encourage science teacher educators to examine their own course curriculum, structure, and pedagogy through self-study and reflection. Overall practices in teacher preparation must empower rather than impede progress toward important goals of CRT, and this may be achieved through building stronger relationships with PTOC and Faculty of Color across teacher preparation courses in support of these goals.

AB We investigated the intersectional nature of race/racism and gender/sexism in broad scale inequities in physics student learning using a critical quantitative intersectionality. To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research-based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first-semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture-based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.

AB As literature indicates, historic racism and implicit bias throughout academia have been profound metrics leading to a lack of diversity, as related to people from underrepresented groups according to race and ethnicity, among biomedical sciences graduate students in U.S. universities. Recognizing such challenges, a team of biomedical scientists and inclusivity educators developed and implemented a pilot training program within an academic health sciences center as an initial step to educate faculty and staff regarding their roles in the promotion of an inclusive academic environment, receptive to all students, including underrepresented students. The 3-h workshop included didactic modules, videos, teaching modules, and active attendee participation. Faculty and staff were presented common terminology and ways to promote the development of an inclusive and diverse academic workforce. Compared with pre-workshop, post-workshop survey results indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of "implicit bias," "status leveling," "color-blind racial attitudes," "tokenism," and "failure to differentiate." Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. This preliminary initiative was successful in the introduction of faculty and staff to the importance of fostering an inclusive academic environment and thereby developing a diverse workforce.

AB This study examines the development of secondary preservice science teachers' (PSTs') sociopolitical understandings in the context of a yearlong, masters-level, justice-oriented teacher education program. It articulates a theoretical perspective regarding teachers' conceptions of the work-of-teaching in terms of pedagogical and disciplinary commitments. These conceptions are ideological links between classroom practices and teachers' understanding of the sociopolitical context of their work. Teachers' conceptions include how they view their and their students' agency to gain access to enabling structures or dissent against oppressive structures that contribute to inequity in science education. The embedded case study design with 10 PSTs draws on various data sources from three time periods, and several types of experiences, in the teacher education program. A focus on four cases illustrates how PSTs rearticulated ideological committments in ways that have direct implications for the development of their practice and also connections to the content areas they teach. One case reinforces that teachers may begin to reject deficit views and embrace their agency by learning about the ways in which racism structures society. Another case shows how PSTs' political clarity may be pushed in the direction of understanding multiple forms of oppression as structural. Together, the four cases illuminate an ideological component to content area teaching, or content area considerations in teachers' ideological committments. Science teachers may develop sophisticated views of their work by analyzing their disciplines and curriculum as structures that are subject to the same critiques levied against other social structures. While PSTs did not feel that justice-centered pedagogies were within their full reach at the end of the program, they moved from aiming to demonstrate to students the utility, value, and importance of content areas toward exploring the relevance of the content areas with students.

AB This paper draws from the writings of Michel Foucault and his recently reconsidered provocations on race and racialization. Using Foucault's definition of 'internal racism,' race is understood as a complex set of correlations that are employed for the purpose of establishing (ab)normality and exercising various forms of expulsion. Racialization is then seen as the circulation of knowledge that makes racial categorization evident as scientific truth, linked to themes of science, developmentality, and the governing of population. To illustrate its subjective materialization, I analyze childhood memories of school told by undergraduates of color at one large public university in New York City. In what follows, I present three narratives that exemplify the production of difference and abnormality, as a biopolitical strategy with racial significance, arguing that positivist school reforms and developmental theories in education cannot be thought of as separate from the mobilization of racial identity and experience. At its end, I argue that we must unravel our familiar ways of thinking about race and push against the constructs of normality that can have detrimental effects on everyday economic, political and social life.

AB Crude and dangerous ideas about the genetic heritability of intelligence, and a supposed biological basis for the Black/White achievement gap, are alive and well inside the education policy process but taking new and more subtle forms. Drawing on Critical Race Theory, the paper analyses recent hereditarian writing, in the UK and the USA, and highlight a strategy that I term racial inexplicitness; this allows hereditarian advocates to adopt a colorblind facade that presents their work as new, exciting and full of promise for all of society. The paper is in two parts: the first exposes the racism that lies hidden in the small print of the new geneism, where wildly misleading assertions about genetic influences on education are proclaimed as scientific fact while race-conscious critics are dismissed as ignorant ideologues. The second part of the paper sets out critical facts about the relevant science, including the difference between the mythic and real meaning of heritability; fundamental problems with the methodology of twin studies; the little-known history of IQ test score manipulation; and the continuing use of a stylistic approach that Howard Gardner characterized as 'scholarly brinkmanship'.

AB This paper considers the emancipatory potential of incorporating youth participatory action research (YPAR) and restorative practices (RP) implementation into a transformative mixed methods study design as a means to create equitable and caring school systems for marginalized youth. The utilization of transformative mixed methods research offers a methodological orientation to legitimize, illuminate, and prioritize perspectives from marginalized youth that may be undervalued, decontextualized, and oversimplified in traditional quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Furthermore, the authors suggest that YPAR and RP align with Critical Theory and Quantitative Criticalism, which are theoretical and methodological frameworks consistent with the transformative paradigm. The integration of these various theoretical, methodological and applied frameworks provides researchers opportunities to flatten hierarchies and actively engage marginalized youth to address the structural and programmatic inequities they experience in schools. Informed by the authors' multi-year university-school district action research partnership, this paper explores how the alignment of YPAR, RP, and transformative mixed methods may promote critical consciousness amongst students, families, staff, and administration in schools. Finally, we also demonstrate how social science researchers can blend YPAR, RP, and transformative mixed methods design to partner with school districts to address structural societal problems, such as racism and inequity.

AB Health inequities stem from systematic, pervasive social and structural forces. These forces marginalize populations and create the circumstances that disadvantage these groups, as reflected in differences in outcomes like life expectancy and infant mortality and in inequitable access to and delivery of health care resources. To help eradicate these inequities, physicians must understand racism, sexism, oppression, historical marginalization, power, privilege, and other sociopolitical and economic forces that sustain and create inequities. A new educational paradigm emphasizing the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to achieve health equity is needed.
   Systems-based practice is the graduate medical education core competency that focuses on complex systems and physicians' roles within them; it includes topics like multidisciplinary team-based care, patient safety, cost containment, end-of-life goals, and quality improvement. This competency, however, is largely health care centric and does not train physicians to engage with the complexities of the social and structural determinants of health or to partner with systems and communities that are outside health care. The authors propose a new core competency centered on health equity, social responsibility, and structural competency to address this gap in graduate medical education. For the development of this new competency, the authors draw on existing, innovative undergraduate and graduate medical pedagogy and public health, health services research, and social medicine frameworks. They describe how this new competency would inform graduate medical education and clinical care and encourage future physicians to engage in the work of health equity.

TI Biological determinism and the narrative of adjustment: The high school
   biology textbooks of Truman Jesse Moon, c.1921-1963
SO CURRICULUM INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
AB While the mainline eugenics movement in early 20th century was closely associated with racism and the European Holocaust and was present in biology textbooks in the early 20(th) century, the following article finds that a transformed eugenics could be found the U.S. science curriculum by mid-century. The following article analyzes the content of 73 high school biology textbooks published between 1914-1964, and traces the patterns in their eugenic content. Those patterns are then compared to the eugenic content in science textbooks written by Truman Jesse Moon and published by Henry Holt between 1921-1963.
   Between 1947-1963, and drawing upon eugenics, the series consistently suggested a broad narrative to their adolescent readers. Identified as a "narrative of adjustment," it contained direct, albeit nonracial, political implications. Rooted as it was in a reform view of eugenics, it built on a dialectical nature-nurture paradigm for human development; on insights from twin studies; on IQ testing; and on the presumption that each individual's immutable heredity sets limits on achievement. The Moon series served as a conduit for this reform version of eugenics, and provided its high school readers with a lens through which to understand themselves and their social world. Placed in the context of a national policy to make schooling socially efficient, the texts provided their readers with a specific life narrative, a narrative of adjustment. Its parameters were clear. Readers should accept their fixed heredity, work hard, and adjust to the world as they find it.

AB Social media are influential sociocultural forces that construct and transmit information about gender, health and bodies to young people in the digital age. In health and physical activity, Chinese people are often represented and positioned differently to other (minority) ethnic groups. For example, Black young people are often understood as having low academic motivations and aspirations but as natural' athletes; in contrast, Chinese young people, seen as the model minority' who excel in STEM subjects, are fragile, reserved and disinterested in physical movements. These public forms of representation may sit in opposition to the young people's embodied identity. When these misrepresentations are internalised, issues such as micro-aggression and racism may have an impact on Chinese young people's health and wellbeing. This paper aims to examine how Chinese bodies are gendered and racialised in contemporary social media sites (e.g. Google News, LiveJournal, Medium, Wordpress). Drawing on critical discourse analysis and Foucault's concepts of normalisation and discursive practice, the paper will problematise the often taken-for-granted gendered and racialised stereotypes related to Chinese physicality and health on social media sites. Implications for developing future research and teaching resources in critical media health literacy for young people on issues related to gender and equity will be provided. The results affect how we understand, represent, and discuss Chinese (young) people on social media sites, thereby how Chinese young people engage, construct, and perform their embodied identities in Western, English speaking societies.

AB Tackling complex twenty-first century global health challenges requires crossdisciplinary collaborations that extend beyond physical classrooms and across continents. The Transdisciplinary Education and Community Health Collaboratory (TEaCH CoLab) is a global teaching co-op established by health promotion and humanities faculty at three universities (Waterford Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Carlow in Ireland, and the University of Washington, Bothell in the U.S.). The primary goals of TEaCH CoLab are to enhance global learning and problem-solving among the next generation of community and public health practitioners, to improve public health teaching (with a focus on digital pedagogy), and to increase empathy and community-connectedness. In this descriptive article, we present our program model and lessons learned from the first three years of collaboration to provide insights into how such capacity-building projects are established and sustained over time and across diverse geographical, cultural and temporal landscapes. Collaboration happens primarily online through academic and community partnerships, collaborative online learning, and pedagogy discussion and development. Students get to engage with course content and experiential learning that is part of a shared, global curriculum which emphasizes social justice, health equity, cultural humility and anti-racism, and advocacy. Our "lessons for the field" are collective, practice-based reflections by members of TEaCH CoLab based on their experiences and their involvement in development and facilitation. Our model for learning may help other health promotion scholars and practitioners develop meaningful global learning experiences that strengthen the interconnectedness of praxis, pedagogy, and communities.

TI GoPro(blem)s and possibilities: Keeping the child human of colour in
   play in an interview
SO CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD
LA English
DT Article
DE Agential realism; Barad; digital play; education research; GoPro;
   interview; South Africa
AB In response to the call for papers for this special issue and the questions it poses, the authors show how the ontological posthumanist shift of agential realism does not erase but keeps the child human of colour in play, despite the inclusion of the other-than-(Adult)human in its methodologies. Through a montaging technique, the authors explore the philosophical complexity of 'decentering without erasure' by re-turning to data from a large international research project - Children, Technology and Play (2019-2020). Through an agential realist reading of interview data 'of' 'seven-year-old' Henry when visiting him at home in an informal settlement in Cape Town, they show what else is going on, and the politically radical and subtle philosophical difference this makes for reconfiguring child subjectivity. To do more justice to the complexity of reality, the analysis bounces around like Henry's sack ball and zooms in on the role apparatuses such as GoPros play in research. The authors 'follow the child' literally but differently, without excluding or erasing the more-than-(Adult)human. In meeting Henry, they also meet Eshal, who introduces the GoPro(blem). By diffractively reading Karen Barad's scholarship through visual and aural texts, the authors respond to the question of how posthumanist research makes a difference to childhood studies. They show how the agential realist move(ment) from Object and Subject to Phenomenon explodes ageist, ableist, racist, extractive and settler-colonial logics in education research.

   and Brazil in science education
SO CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Science education; Anti-racist education; Effects of coloniality;
   Decolonial pedagogy; Freirean pedagogy
AB The aim of this work is to reflect on the challenging trajectory of international cooperation between East Timor and Brazil, which focused on the need to rethink teacher education from a critical intercultural perspective, aiming to build emancipatory relations, love, and solidarity. From 2009 until 2016, we coordinated the Qualification of Teachers and Teaching of the Portuguese Language program in East Timor, inspired by the dialogicity of Paulo Freire, an educator well known and beloved by the Timorese people for his indirect contribution to the independence of that country. Freire's dialectic denunciation-annunciation was essential to identify the problems and propose solutions with the Timorese and not only for them. In addition, through our experiences in that country, we identified issues like those of Brazilian education as the effects of coloniality and introjections of inferiority and subordination, as well as the transnationalization of education, among other problems. Thus, the Freirean dialectic denunciation-announcement of this praxis, together with Timorese education, drove us to examine our own Brazilian territory, provoking intersectional reflections related to racism, gender and sexuality issues, and social class prejudice, among other forms of oppression. It deepened ways of acting based on critical interculturality and the concept of decolonial pedagogy, which suggested ways to fight for social justice in science education.

TI Using Discrimination Response Ideation to Uncover Student Attitudes

AB Helping students learn to identify and respond to situations involving discrimination is important, especially in fields like Computer Science where there is evidence of an unwelcoming climate that disproportionately drives underrepresented students out of the field. While students should not be considered responsible for fixing issues around discrimination in their institutions, they do have a role to play. In this paper, we present the results of a study in which 318 undergraduate computer science majors were presented with scenarios of discrimination and asked to identify the issues, rate the severity of the issues, and ideate 3-5 responses to address the described situations. They were also asked to identify which of their responses would likely be most effective in addressing discrimination and which of their responses they would be most likely to use if they were in the situation described in real life. Our results show that while students generally are able to identify various forms of discrimination (sexism, racism, religious discrimination, ethnic discrimination, etc.), any ambiguity in a scenario led to students describing the scenario as less severe and/or as an example of oversensitivity. We also show that students come up with many passive responses to scenarios of discrimination (such as ignoring the situation or wishing it had not happened in the first place). Students in our study were more likely to say they would deploy passive responses in real life, shying away from responses that involve direct confrontation. We observed some differences between student demographic subgroups. Women and BIPOC students in CS tend to think these issues are more severe than men andWhite and Asian students in CS. Women are more likely to ideate direct confrontation responses and report willingness to use direct confrontation responses in real situations. Our work contributes a methodology for examining student awareness and understanding of diversity issues as well as a demonstration that undergraduate computer science students need help in learning how to address common situations that involve either intentional or unintentional discrimination in an academic environment.

AB This article reports on the views of seven Asian female Social Science students following a class seminar on religious issues and schooling at a university in the UK. It explores the importance of the post-class spontaneous student dialogue where participation in much teaching and learning is voluntary. The concern is with engaged pedagogy and interactive teaching methods that allow space for students to voice their views and experiences. This is especially important when dealing with ocontroversialo topics such as Islamophobia - anti-Muslim racism - and owar on terroro. Whilst the issues are provocative, some students remain silent and do not participate in the formal class setting; they hold back their comments for a less exposed moment. In this case, the post-class discussion threw up insights into the reasons for student osilenceso and possibilities for obreakingo them. A key insight is the importance of osafer spaceso, usually after classes, in the corridors and refectories, and how to bring the discussions back into the classroom environment. Another is the political significance of ocounter-storieso told in safety for pedagogic and political theory and practice. This article refers to one such moment and explores the value of post-class student ocounter-narrativeso that developed organically.

DT Article
ID BLACK; LANGUAGE
AB In this article, I propose Critical Race English Education (CREE) as a theoretical and pedagogical construct that tackles white supremacy and anti-black racism within English education and ELA classrooms. I employ autoethnography and counterstorytelling as methods that center my multiple identities and lived realities as I document my racialized and gendered experiences in relation to my journey to Ferguson, MO and my experiences as a secondary ELA teacher. The research questions guiding this study are the following: (I) As a Black male English educator and language and literacy scholar, how am I implicated in the struggle for racial justice and what does it mean for me to teach literacy in our present-day justice movement?; (2) How are Black lives mattering in ELA classrooms?; and, (3) How are we using Black youth life histories and experiences to inform our mindset, curriculum, and pedagogical practices in the classroom? This article explicates findings from three interconnected stories that work to show how CREE can be operationalized to better understand the #BlackLivesMatter movement in its historical and contemporary dimensions. The data analyzed stem from my autobiographical narratives, observations, social media artifacts, and images. I aim to expand English education to be more synergistically attuned to racial justice issues dealing with police brutality, the mass incarceration of Black people, and legacies of grassroots activism. This analysis suggests implications that aim to move the pedagogical practices around the intersections of anti-blackness and literacy from the margins to the center of discussion and praxis in ELA contexts.

TI Race-Conscious Professionalism and African American Representation in
   Academic Medicine
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MINORITY PHYSICIANS; CARE
AB African Americans remain substantially less likely than other physicians to hold academic appointments. The roots of these disparities stem from different extrinsic and intrinsic forces that guide career development. Efforts to ameliorate African American underrepresentation in academic medicine have traditionally focused on modifying structural and extrinsic barriers through undergraduate and graduate outreach, diversity and inclusion initiatives at medical schools, and faculty development programs. Although essential, these initiatives fail to confront the unique intrinsic forces that shape career development. America's ignoble history of violence, racism, and exclusion exposes African American physicians to distinct personal pressures and motivations that shape professional development and career goals. This article explores these intrinsic pressures with a focus on their historical roots; reviews evidence of their effect on physician development; and considers the implications of these trends for improving African American representation in academic medicine. The paradigm of "race-conscious professionalism" is used to understand the dual obligation encountered by many minority physicians not only to pursue excellence in their field but also to leverage their professional stature to improve the well-being of their communities. Intrinsic motivations introduced by race-conscious professionalism complicate efforts to increase the representation of minorities in academic medicine. For many African American physicians, a desire to have their work focused on the community will be at odds with traditional paths to professional advancement. Specific policy options are discussed that would leverage race-conscious professionalism as a draw to a career in academic medicine, rather than a force that diverts commitment elsewhere.

TI Ethnicity and Gender in Museum Representations of Human Evolution The
   Unquestioned and the Challenged in Learners' Meaning Making
SO SCIENCE & EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SCIENCE; ACCEPTANCE; LANGUAGE; STUDENTS
AB Scientific representations of human evolution often embrace stereotypes of ethnicity and gender that are more aligned with socio-cultural discourses and norms than empirical facts. The present study has two connected aims: to understand how ethnicity and gender are represented in an exhibition about human evolution, and to understand how that representation influences learners' meaning making. First, we analysed an exhibition with realistic reconstructions of early hominids in a museum of natural history, to identify dualisms related to the representation of gender and ethnicity that have been recognised in research. Then, we studied the processes of meaning making in the exhibition during an out-of-school educational activity, in which groups of teenaged students explore and discuss the hominid reconstructions. Our results show that the exhibition displays human evolution in the form of a linear sequence from a primitive African prehistory to a more advanced European present. Behind this depiction of human evolution lies stereotypic notions of ethnicity and gender: notions that were incorporated into the students' meaning making during the educational activity. When students noticed aspects of ethnicity, their meaning making did not dispute the messages represented in the exhibition; these were accepted as scientific facts. Conversely, when the students noticed aspects related to gender, they often adopted a more critical stance and challenged the representations from different perspectives. We discuss the implications of our findings for exhibit design and evolution education more generally. In doing so, we offer our perspectives on the design of learning environments to salvage inherently sexist, racist, imperial science.

AB Here, we present the results of a study of in-service teachers' responses to equity-based case study vignettes focused on racialized classroom incidents. This study was conducted in the context of an ongoing research practice partnership aimed at integrating computer science concepts in elementary grades. Our work took place in a public school district that enrolls primarily students of color, while largely employing White teachers and administrators. Using a racial literacy framework [Guinier 2004], we conceptualized a continuum and developed codes to analyze teachers' responses from racially liberal to racially literate. Our results describe a range of positions across the continuum, including those consistent with the racial liberalism viewpoint that expresses individualistic views of meritocracy and colorblindness that sometimes supports a deficit view of students, those that reside in the middle who validate equity work through minimal acknowledgment yet find ways to resist further engagement with race or equity, and those who express views consistent with racial literacy practices including student-centered perspectives, asset-orientations, and the willingness to engage race directly. Further, our results indicate that teachers may express contradictory views or views across the continuum. These findings point to the developmental nature of racial literacy and the difficulty of unlearning racist mindsets. We discuss the efficacy of our case study design: anonymized, locally derived vignettes, and our case study learning activity design: written reflections, small group dialogues, and whole group share-outs in supporting teacher reflection and learning. Finally, we demonstrate the special leadership role of teachers who are moving toward racial literacy.

AB Concern has arisen for the safety of children using the Internet to support their education outside the school context. Inappropriate material such as pornography, inflammatory and racist writings can be accessed both by accident and with deliberate intent to view. Children are also perceived to be at risk from approaches by strangers, particularly in web-based chat rooms.
   A survey of the international literature in this area highlighted worldwide concern for the safety of young Internet users and it was generally agreed that schools have a fundamental role in ensuring their safety. The survey findings indicated that a thorough audit of Internet Safety teaching and practices was a vital stage in examining these practices and informing future planning.
   This paper reports on the consequent audit of Internet Safety practices in over 500 schools from 27 Local Education Authorities (LEAs) across England, commissioned by Becta and conducted during the Summer term 2002. Independent, state and special schools were included in the survey at both primary and secondary levels. ICT advisors from the sampled LEAs and representatives of Internet Safety organisations were also invited to complete a linked questionnaire.
   A number of recommendations for Internet Safety teaching, in particular, ensuring that children are aware of safe practices for surfing the Internet in less regulated contexts outside the school, will be presented based on the evidence gathered in the survey.
   Additionally emerging concerns for Internet Safety practices in schools such as the technical and moral difficulties of filtering Internet access via mobile technologies will be highlighted. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; AMERICANS; STUDENTS
AB The H&P 360 is a reconceptualized history and physical (H&P), which clinical medical students have reported reveals clinically relevant information not elicited by the traditional H&P, informs care planning, promotes interprofessional team care, and enhances patient rapport. In addition to the traditional checklist focused on patients' medical conditions, the H&P 360 includes prompts for gathering limited but critical information in 6 other domains directly relevant to patients' overall health-patient values, goals, and priorities; mental health; behavioral health; social support; living environment and resources; and function. Clinicians are thus reminded to elicit relevant information from each domain appropriate to the context of each clinical encounter.As health systems explore ways to identify and address social drivers of health, medical schools are rapidly expanding curricula beyond biomedical conditions, as reflected in the multifaceted health systems science curriculum. Many of today's medical students struggle to find connections among the core tasks of mastering biomedical clinical medicine, their evolving professional identity and career trajectory, and addressing systemic and societal barriers to population health.The authors argue that the 7-domain framework can serve as a conceptual bridge that links the care of individual patients with topics in the health systems science curriculum to promote health equity. The authors provide illustrative examples of the 7 domains as an organizing lens that can promote curiosity and understanding of seemingly disparate topics, such as interpersonal violence, social drivers of health, and structural racism, as well as help students expand and define their professional identities as physicians beyond diagnosis and treatment of biomedical conditions.The authors invite discussion and experimentation around the use of the 7-domain framework in teaching, assessment, and curriculum development and point to resources for clinical educators for teaching and measuring the effects of the H&P 360 on learners, preceptors, and patients.

TI Governmentality and the study of education policy in South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID POWER
AB The article applies Foucault's idea of governmentality to an understanding of education policy in South Africa. An account is given of govern mentality theory, as it has developed in relation to western industrialized countries and, in a more specialized literature, as it has been applied to illiberal states such as the apartheid state. The article then applies this theory to an understanding of governmentality as it is evolving in the post-apartheid era. Using selected examples, education policy is then analysed against this backdrop. it is argued that studying policy through the lens of governmentality theory allows for a consideration of the autonomous effects of rationalities of government on shaping the possibilities of policy and invoking different forms of power. Important for this understanding is a view of the changing role of the human sciences it) underpinning different rationalities of government. It is also argued that educational change can be understood as an aspect of changing governmentality and to the emergence of a new global, neo-liberal rationality of government. Although the form of the state emerging in South Africa is a variant of the advanced liberal state, it also differs in its underlying logic on account of deep rooted inequality and the persistence of a bio-political racism that remains entrenched from the apartheid era.

AB Objective: The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is an award- winning biography engaging its readers on important topics ranging from race, science and ethics to the social determinants of health. However, the multiple pedagogic impacts of this book on the public health classroom setting have yet to be comprehensively explored.
   Method: A qualitative, pre/post- test study design assessed the perceptions of 17 Master's of Public Health students on topics of health disparities and medical ethics. A total of 14 students were assigned to an intervention (book- based seminar course; Cohort A) and 3 students acted as the non- intervention group (Cohort B) over a study period of 10 weeks.
   Results: A thematic analysis uncovered more profound changes in the perceptions of the intervention group. All students were aware of health disparities over the course of the 10- week class; however, significant traction was gained on more complex issues linked to the social determinants of health. Specifically, students in the intervention group showed deeper perceptions about health inequalities with a particular focus on racial disparities.
   Conclusion: Although graduate students in the public health discipline were well aware of health inequalities, a seminar course surrounding a popular book about Henrietta Lacks afforded students a more concrete understanding for why and how race and racism in health disparities exist.

TI Getting into the habit: using historical science to understand race in
   contemporary schools
SO RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE race; racism; history of race; John Dewey
AB Most historical analyses of the scientific study of race focus on the surface level physical features of differing bodies. They fail to consider the scientific and popular accounts of racialized bodies as engaged in routine activity, thereby overlooking corporeal habits as the key historical tenet of the construction of scientific racial categorization. This paper traces the study of race via habits through modern science and attempts to reconcile this approach to understanding race with contemporary popular notions that uphold the lived experience of race and conflicting genetic accounts that debunk racial distinction. Moreover, the paper explores habits of discerning and living race that are cultivated in schools and through popular culture. Offering a pragmatist and poststructuralist theoretical analysis of habit as socially and biologically co-constituted, this paper argues that habits should overtly occupy the minds of scientists, social constructionists, and teachers as they enact and respond to race. It urges these scholars and social activists to move beyond the claim that race is a social construction to understanding the historical intention of the construct and its link to racism. Finally, this paper considers how students in schools learn both to detect and embody race via habits and calls for making those habits more flexible as a way to promote a positive future for living and responding to race.

   representation; Television media
ID WELFARE; IDEOLOGY; WOMEN; WORK; RACE
AB The animated children's television show, Doc McStuffins, may serve as an out-of-school multicultural STEM education platform for its young television audience. The lead character, as well as the supporting cast of toy characters, represents a variety of racial, ethnic, and cultural identities while modeling medicine and healthcare practices. A critical race sociological perspective recognizes that, in the U.S., racism and social stratification are endemic and this practice of culturally characterizing the toys is situated within a larger historical and sociopolitical context where different cultures, identities, and communities experience differences in power, privilege, and oppression. At times, toys were representative of communities that have historically endured oppression, e.g. communities of color, immigrant communities, and communities with low-income status. Furthermore, in the show, the doctor diagnoses and responds to medical challenges faced by the toy characters and these medical challenges were, at times, caused or exacerbated by the behavior or disposition of some of the toys themselves. Thus, toys were also variably characterized as exhibiting problematic healthcare behavior, while some toys exhibited positive healthcare behavior. Healthcare behavior was similarly located within an ideological context which has associated communities of color, especially those with low-income status, with irresponsible, self-destructive behavior and dependency, as well as an overburdened welfare state. Of concern was the intersection, especially disproportionately, of problematic healthcare behavior and toys representative of communities that have endured these and other related negative characterizations. Through counter-storytelling, the dominant narrative of the television show foregrounded in diversity is complicated to trace adaptive and resilient racial ideologies into new settings and structures. The ideological underpinnings and limitations of diversity itself in our current sociopolitical context are utilized to further examine the phenomenon within the television show.

DE Sylvia Wynter; coloniality; Black Studies; educational theory;
   curriculum studies; epistemology
ID COLONIALITY
AB In her scholarship of the past five decades, Sylvia Wynter has woven a critique of education in Caribbean, European, African, and American societies. In addition, her work demonstrates how education globally structures a particular cultural, historical, and onto-epistemic anti-Black/anti-Indigenous worldview. In Wynter's most neglected piece of work 'Do Not Call Us Negros' How Multicultural Textbooks Perpetuate Racism she weaponizes the second and third wave of her work(1) to unpack and provide a fresh critique to the Black English debates that occurred in California in the 1990s. In this, she reframes debates about history curriculum and culture from a white conservative nativist one of Man (the status quo) to the alternative Black Studies Alterity Perspective rooted in the liminal Black socio-historical-cultural experiences. Continuing Wynter's layered excavation of education as the site of EuroAmerican cultural reproduction, I sketch out a different philosophical discourse to those grounded in capital and/or race debates of the social sciences; I present a philosophical European coming of age story of humanism as a distant stage in how the West became self-aware and created a consciousness of itself. In doing so, this Western European humanism, or what Wynter coins Man for short, embarked on a 500-year journey of colonialism/coloniality to plunder the gifts and talents of the minds and bodies of non-middle-class, non-European populations through a process/technique of what I coin Neocolonial Mind Snatching.

TI Roadmap for Trauma-Informed Medical Education: Introducing an Essential

AB Research has established that trauma is nearly universal and a root cause of numerous health and social problems, including 6 of the 10 leading causes of death, with devastating consequences across the life course. Scientific evidence now recognizes the complex injurious nature of structural and historical trauma (i.e., racism, discrimination, sexism, poverty, and community violence). Meanwhile, many physicians and trainees grapple with their own trauma histories and face direct and secondary traumatization on the job. These findings substantiate the profound impact of trauma on the brain and body and why trauma training is critical to the education and practice of physicians. However, a critical lag remains in translating essential research insights into clinical teaching and care. Recognizing this gap, the National Collaborative on Trauma-Informed Health Care Education and Research (TIHCER) formed a task force charged with developing and validating a summary of core trauma-related knowledge and skills for physicians. In 2022, TIHCER released the first-ever validated set of trauma-informed care competencies for undergraduate medical education. The task force focused on undergraduate medical education so that all physicians would be taught these foundational concepts and skills from the outset of training, recognizing that faculty development is needed to achieve this goal. In this Scholarly Perspective, the authors offer a roadmap for implementation of trauma-informed care competencies starting with medical school leadership, a faculty-student advisory committee, and sample resources. Medical schools can use the trauma-informed care competencies as a scaffold to customize integration of curricular content (what is taught) and efforts to transform the learning and clinical environments (how it is taught). Using the lens of trauma will ground undergraduate medical training in the latest science about the pathophysiology of disease and provide a framework to address many of our greatest challenges, including health disparities and professional burnout.

TI MULTICULTURALISM AND SCIENCE EDUCATION
SO PHILOSOPHY, SCIENCE, EDUCATION AND CULTURE
SE Science & Technology Education Library
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Science educators and theoreticians of science education who have embraced multiculturalism proceed as if multiculturalism is a univocal and non-problematic approach that can be fruitfully applied to science education. We believe, however, that neither the existence of a distinctly multiculturalist interpretation of scientific activity nor a consensus about the meaning and the practical consequences of multiculturalism itself can be taken for granted. Multiculturalism is not a single and unproblematically formulated theory or strategy waiting to be applied to science education. A philosophically informed consideration of its implications for science education would have to address both what is valuable about it and its inner tensions and limitations.
   Before we proceed any further, it will be useful to make a distinction between 'multiculturalism' and 'multicultural education'. Both of these terms have been used in so many different senses that it would be impossible to give an exhaustive list. For example, The International Encyclopaedia of Education defines 'multicultural education' as
   an educational process or strategy involving more than one culture, as defined by national, linguistic, ethnic or racial criteria. It is supposed to create an awareness, tolerance, understanding and knowledge regarding different cultures as well as the differences and similarities between cultures and their related world views, concepts, values, beliefs and attitudes. It is intended to provide cognitive, verbal, and nonverbal skills in coping with different cultures or cultural groups, and skills in communicating with members of these groups. It is also intended to promote academic and social achievement in intercultural settings (Ekstrand 1994, p. 3963).
   While this definition emphasizes communication and understanding between cultures, the entry on multicultural education in The Encyclopaedia of Educational Research emphasizes equal opportunity to students with diverse social, racial and ethnic backgrounds:
   As an idea, multicultural education espouses the notion that male and female students, students from diverse racial, ethnic and social-class groups, and students with disabilities should have an equal opportunity to learn in schools, colleges, and universities. Multicultural education is also a process whose major aim is to change the social structure and culture of schools and other educational institutions, so that students from all cultural, racial, ethnic, gender, and social-class groups will have an equal opportunity to experience academic success (Banks 1992, p. 870).
   It would be more accurate to say that the ideal of multicultural education incorporates both concerns above, as the following passage emphasizes: Education of diverse cultural groups, through a wide range of culturally impregnated experiences, for life in a multiracial and multiethnic society at both local and global levels. The ultimate goals are the promotion of social cohesion through critical awareness and the establishment and maintenance of a socially just society through the acceptance and celebration of diversity, the enhancement of the self-esteem of all, and the elimination of racism. (Hodson 1993, p. 689; emphasis original)
   Multicultural education as described in these passages is a need that has emerged because today's modern, complex societies are multicultural societies: they consist of people with different native languages, religions, and ethnic origins. This creates the need for mutual understanding and tolerance regarding different cultural beliefs and practices among the members of a society. Moreover, those cultural groups that form a minority in a given society are often disadvantaged economically, socially and politically due to various reasons. Education is an effective way of creating conditions for equality as well as mutual tolerance and understanding among members of different groups. "Multicultural education' is the name given to the policies of education that address these issues in multicultural societies.
   It seems obvious to us that education should certainly be available to all regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religious, cultural and class backgrounds, and the aim of critical inquiry which we defend in this book is certainly compatible with creating awareness and understanding regarding different cultures provided that they are not sealed off from criticism.
   On the other hand, the term "multiculturalism', as it appears in theoretical literature in the social sciences, is used to refer to a certain kind of politics of recognition. What this means will be made clear below. In the science education literature, however, 'multiculturalism' has acquired a meaning of its own; it refers to a certain constellation of epistemic doctrines that form an alternative to the universalist conception of science. To distinguish it from other forms of multiculturalism, we call it epistemic multiculturalism.
   Since there is little discussion of multiculturalism in a broader theoretical context in the literature on science education, we begin, in Section 13.1, by introducing multiculturalism as it has emerged in the social sciences in the last two decades and relate it to issues in science education. Multiculturalism in this broader context is a kind of politics of recognition. We discuss what is valuable and what is problematic in it both generally and specifically from the viewpoint of science education. In Section 13.2 we present an alternative to multiculturalism, an alternative which avoids what is problematic in multiculturalism as a politics of recognition. We then turn to epistemic multiculturalism and its conception of science in Sections 13.3 and 13.4. We argue that epistemic multiculturalism is even more problematic than multiculturalism as a politics of recognition; we reject it categorically. Many epistemic multiculturalists claim that indigenous and ecological knowledge developed by indigenous peoples (what is sometimes known as "ethnoscience') constitute an alternative science to the standard, mainstream science practiced in the West and that therefore they should be incorporated into science education. We take up this issue in Sections 13.5 and 13.6. Despite the fact that epistemic multiculturalism is put forward as an alternative to the universalistic conception of science, the latter is poorly understood by epistemic multiculturalists. In Section 13.7 we define what we mean by universalism in science and defend it against multiculturalists' attacks. In Section 13.8 we state our view concerning the relationship between science and values, an issue epistemic multiculturalists especially bring up in comparing "ethnoscience' with mainstream science. We conclude this chapter in Section 13.9 by noting that epistemic multiculturalism loses the sight of critical inquiry as the overriding aim of education in the science classroom.

AB Knowledge of functional groups provides students with a language for organic chemistry. However, students in a health science chemistry course do not plan to be synthetic organic chemists and, therefore, need examples of how functional group chemistry is relevant to their vocational goals. We have developed a lab to demonstrate how simple functional group chemistry is used in laboratory testing, namely, the "pee test", or dipstick urinalysis. Dipstick urinalysis is frequently used to screen for various conditions and is used weekly in the last month of pregnancy. Our lab models the prenatal clinical environment. The laboratory allows for testing of chemical species that support a medical diagnosis: albumin testing for preeclampsia; leukocytes, nitrites, and pH for urinary tract infection; glucose, ketones, and pH to test for gestational diabetes, alcoholism, or other serious metabolic diseases. The related lessons are designed to support students in understanding the reactions involved in testing, biochemistry related to diagnosis, and general understandings of how tests are interpreted. In developing this experiment, we were confronted with disparities in prenatal care, namely, the absence of culturally competent care, inequitable access to care, and toxic stress due to racism that contribute to dramatically increased maternal death rates for women of color in the US. We identified resources to educate students on culturally competent care. These resources include reference to the way in which the "pee test" is administered. We have incorporated this resource into our lab with appropriate reflection questions, based on our newly devised cultural competence and social justice framework for chemistry students. Our findings indicated that student understandings of the chemistry and testing methods were adequate; on average, 77% of samples were properly diagnosed. With respect to social justice and cultural competence, we found that students predominantly discussed two elements of the cultural competence and social justice framework: reflection on privilege in society and agency to promote equity in healthcare.

AB Background: Within the context of high school student clubs, the acronym "GSA" originally stood for "Gay-Straight Alliance." It described gay and straight youth working as allies to learn about themselves and each other's lives and to navigate and address interpersonal and institutional anti-LGBTQ school policies and practices. Today, the acronym is commonly parsed by Gen Z members as "Gender-Sexuality Alliance" to better represent the presence and needs of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming students, and their cisgender allies. Purpose of Study: We inquire how students learn about themselves and others-partially, unevenly, and, at times, uneasily-as they incorporate socially resistant gender and race identity work within their GSA school clubs. Participants: Participants were cisgender (n = 10) and transgender and nonbinary (n = 10), racially diverse high school students in GSAs between 14 and 18 years of age. Research Design: Our analysis is grounded in critical pragmatism, a methodological integration of critical theory and pragmatism, which stems from reflexive immersion in the research context and use of empirical inquiry as a tool to acknowledge and guide transformation of entrenched anti-trans oppression in schools, noting that racism, among other forms of structural inequality, is built into schools. We analyzed the interview component of a larger mixed-methods research study conducted by the GLSEN Research Institute, which was intended to generate insight about student and advisor experiences of GSAs. Findings: Our study reveals that while GSAs can be a space for marginalized LGBTQ students to create a collective empowering identity, they can also be a space where some differences may be flattened or left out. We explore how students make visible racial and gender identity groups during GSA activities that are often erased in secondary schools. This implicitly and explicitly entails deploying identity as a challenge to a school's heteronormative, cisnormative, and white-dominant official curriculum, although the depth or complexity of a GSA's visibility-based education and critique may be inadequate, given available resources. Our findings demonstrate how GSA students leverage their identity as a goal when mobilizing themselves and their peers to alter a school's norms and practices. Conclusions: Gen Z GSA students have begun to reimagine their clubs as if they were built from the ground up, with the needs of transgender students and students of color placed at their center. GSAs remain a critical but underdeveloped resource for learning how to recognize and challenge intersectional forms of interpersonal and institutional marginalization.

AB Introduction. The universities around the world attach great importance to acquiring self-management skills for students while training at the university. Recent studies have proven that these skills have a major role in the development of human personality and academic competencies. Communication and thinking skills are considered to be one of the most important skills that have become taught and have been included in the curricula in almost all Saudi universities. This process involves both theoretical and practical aspects, aiming to provide the student with the necessary knowledge to deal with the other, to use new technologies, to be able to think positively, and to solve problems.
   The aim of the present research is to assess the impact of communication and thinking skills formation on the development of self-management skills among male and female students of the preparatory year in Northern Border University (Arar, Saudi Arabia).
   Methodology and research methods. In the course of the research, the survey method was applied. The survey received responses from 400 students of eight faculties from the Northern Border University (200 male and 200 female students). To draw comparisons between male and female students' perspectives, the Student's t-test was used. The research hypotheses were validated, and the obtained data were statistically processed.
   Results. The survey results indicate that there is a substantial difference in male and female student perspectives regarding the impact of communication and thinking skills. It was found out that male students had a much more positive perspective while considering its impact on self-development, on the development of successful social circles, and the ability to teamwork. On the other hand, according to the female students, the development of communication and thinking skills has a positive impact on problem-solving ability, mental ability, intellectual development, creative thinking, and practical life application or life realism of students.
   Scientific novelty. The present study confirms the importance of the implication of academic programmes aimed at students' self-development; as such training programmes allow students to cope with the challenges of the era of technology and remote communication. In addition to training programmes directed to positive thinking in the light of the challenges facing the world such as terrorism, extremist ideology, and racism, this study comes as an important step towards enhancing self-development skills in the field of communication and human reasoning for undergraduate students.
   Practical significance. The authors formulated the recommendations to reform the system of particular educational services, to improve their quality due to the fastest, synchronous implementation of technological innovations and modern equipment, and to support teachers' competencies at the proper level. The importance of media education development actualises the creation of academic programmes at universities for the training of qualified teachers in the field of specific education, especially for countries, which do not have the same experience of training, since media education is becoming compulsory in the contemporary world, increasingly affecting the formation of individuals, culture, and society. Several proposals have been made to promote further research in this direction.

AB BackgroundThis study assesses the impact of the Interprofessional Global Health Course (IPGHC) on students' fundamental global health knowledge and personal viewpoints on global health domains. It explores the evolution of students' understanding of global health specifically in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsNinety-nine students were selected from 123 McGill student applicants based on their motivation and commitment to take part in IPGHC's ten-week 2020 curriculum. These IPGHC students were eligible to participate in the study. The study's design is sequential explanatory mixed methods. The cross-sectional survey (quantitative phase) appraises students' global health learning outcomes using pre- and post-course surveys, with the use of 5-point Likert-scale questions. The descriptive qualitative survey (qualitative phase) further explores the impact of IPGHC on student's understanding of global health and the reflections of students on the COVID-19 pandemic after IPGHC. The post-course survey included a course evaluation for quality improvement purposes.ResultsOf the 99 students, 81 students across multiple undergraduate and graduate disciplines participated in the study by completing the course surveys. Mean knowledge scores of the following 11 global health topics were increased between pre- and post-course survey: Canadian Indigenous health (P < 0.001), global burden of disease (P < 0.001), global surgery (P < 0.001), infectious diseases and neglected tropical diseases (P < 0.001), refugee and immigrant health (P < 0.001), research and development of drugs (P < 0.001), role of politics and policies in global health (P = 0.02), role of technology in global health (P < 0.001), sexual violence (P < 0.001), systemic racism in healthcare (P = 0.03), and trauma in the global health context (P < 0.001). A positive change in student viewpoints was observed in response to questions regarding their perception of the importance of global health education in their own professional health care programs (P < 0.001), and their understanding of the roles and responsibilities of other healthcare professionals (P < 0.001). In the post-course survey open-ended questions, students exemplified their knowledge gained during the course to create a more informed definition of global health. Several recurring themes were identified in the student reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic, notably policy and politics, followed by access to healthcare and resources.ConclusionThis study emphasizes the need for interprofessional global health education at the university level and demonstrates how rapidly global health learners can apply their knowledge to evolving contexts like the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Background: People who are racialized, gendered, or otherwise minoritized are underrepresented in computing professions in North America. This is reflected in undergraduate computer science (CS) programs, in which students from marginalized backgrounds continue to experience inequities that do not typically affect White cis-men. This is especially true for Black students in general, and Black women in particular, whose experience of systemic, anti-Black racism compromises their ability to persist and thrive in CS education contexts.
   Objectives: This systematic mapping study endeavours to (1) determine the quantity of existing non-deficit-based studies concerned with the persistence of Black students in undergraduate CS; (2) summarize the findings and recommendations in those studies; and (3) identify areas in which additional studies may be required. We aim to accomplish these objectives by way of two research questions: (RQ1) What factors are associated with Black students' persistence in undergraduate CS programs?; and (RQ2) What recommendations have been made to further bolster Black students' persistence in undergraduate CS education programs?
   Methods: This systematic mapping study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines. Studies were identified by conducting keyword searches in seven databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to capture studies illuminating persistence factors for Black students in undergraduate CS programs. To ensure the completeness of our search results, we engaged in snowballing and an expert-based search to identify additional studies of interest. Finally, data were collected from each study to address the research questions outlined above.
   Results: Using the methods outlined above, we identified 16 empirical studies, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies informed by a range of theoretical frameworks. Based on data collected from the primary studies in our sample, we identified 13 persistence factors across four categories: (I) social capital, networking, & support; (II) career & professional development; (III) pedagogical & programmatic interventions; and (IV) exposure & access. This data-collection process also yielded 26 recommendations across six stakeholder groups: (i) researchers; (ii) colleges and universities; (iii) the computing industry; (iv) K-12 systems and schools; (v) governments; and (vi) parents.
   Conclusion: This systematic mapping study resulted in the identification of numerous persistence factors for Black students in CS. Crucially, however, these persistence factors allow Black students to persist, but not thrive, in CS. Accordingly, we contend that more needs to be done to address the systemic inequities faced by Black people in general, and Black women in particular, in computing programs and professions. As evidenced by the relatively small number of primary studies captured by this systematic mapping study, there exists an urgent need for additional, asset-based empirical studies involving Black students in CS. In addition to foregrounding the intersectional experiences of Black women in CS, future studies should attend to the currently understudied experiences of Black men.
